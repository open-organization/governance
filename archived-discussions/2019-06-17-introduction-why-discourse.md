# Introduction: Why Discourse?

Hi friends,

As we discussed at last week's meeting, we'll be adopting Discourse as a platform for facilitating ambassador community connection and collaboration outside our monthly meetings. Later today, you'll be receiving an invitation to join our new home (I wanted to provide this advance notice so you knew it was legitimate, not spam, not some kind of Bitcoin extortion scheme, etc.). From then on, you can access it at:

[www.theopenorganization.community](http://www.theopenorganization.community)

Discourse is an open source discussion platform that's easy to learn and shouldn't over-complicate our existing workflows and processes. Adopting it helps us achieve several goals for community growth in 2019 and beyond:

**1. Establish a space for ambassador discussion outside meetings**
As we continue to grow, our one-hour-per-month meetings just don't give us the time and bandwidth we require to share everything we'd like, to collaborate and thoroughly as we could, etc. Now we have a space for interacting more regularlyâ€”so we can make the most of those face-to-face meetings.

**2. Create a more robust knowledge commons**
Discourse keeps version-controlled, open-formatted versions of our communications and our resources, so it's a nice way to collect and retain all the institutional knowledge our group continues to build. It'll all be located in an accessible and easy-to-read place, so newcomers can browse it (and we can reference it!).

**3. Make community resources more accessible**
Historically we've used a Red Hat-supported Google Docs platform to host and share documents and other resources. But this platform sits behind Red Hat's gateways, which makes sharing and accessing it more difficult and complicated than we'd like. Discourse grants us more flexibility and freedom.

**4. Lay groundwork for potentially public-facing communication channels**
The recent retirement of our IRC channel (RIP) means we've lost one channel for engaging with readers and other folks who occasionally have questions about our work, seek advice on issues, etc. At the moment, our Discourse platform is accessible only to Open Organization Ambassadors; however, in the future we may considering opening part of it to interactions with others.

Discourse is not meant to replace any of our other platforms or communication channels. Our GitHub organization is the critical and de facto place for open and public work on our projects (books, the Open Organization Definition, etc.). The <openorg-list> mailing list is still the best place to tap the broader open organization community (ambassadors and writers and readers and anyone else who has chosen to join it and follow the journey). Discourse is a place for ambassadors to collaborate and congregate in a more direct and private way.

I am currently in the process of migrating existing resources and planning documents from Google Drive to Discourse. If it's not there now, rest assured it will be soon.

If I've configured this thing properly, then everyone should have the ability to post, add materials, and otherwise begin making the place our own. That said, I most definitely welcome advice and feedback from folks more experienced with Discourse than I am (read: pretty much everyone).

So when the invitations arrive, jump in, poke around, and get talkin'. At the moment, all I see is multiple instances of my own creepily smiling face staring back at me and it's unsettling.

Peace, love, and open source,
BB
