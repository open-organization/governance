# Volunteer Needed for Ambassador Meeting manager
HeidiHVL | 2022-05-24 14:10:46 UTC | #1

Hi all! 

I happily ran the May Ambassador meeting but with all the work I'm doing on the Open Leadership Assessment, which is about to get more time-consuming as we move to pilot the survey, I don't have the capacity to create, coordinate, and run the Ambassador meetings. 

Would you like to volunteer? 
I'm estimating it's 90-120 minutes a month (30-60 setup/wrapup, 60 min meeting). 

Thanks,
Heidi

I was just going to try to figure out who I might toss [this agenda item](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/issues/9) to... I also can't be this person, but:

I can run the June meeting as we search for someone to play a more permanent role coordinating it. @HeidiHVL, I would just need to ask you to please send me (privately) your BlueJeans moderator code so I can record the meeting. The video will get dumped into your BlueJeans account when we're finished, so unfortunately I'll need to ask you to log it in our archive.

Meeting invitation and agenda document are on the way!

**Update:** [Agenda](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/june-07-2022-meeting/349)!

I would like to join the team as an ambassador.

Thanks for reaching out, @psehgaft! It's great to hear from you.

Community members achieve ambassador status through a [community nomination and voting process](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roles#ambassadors). Community members become Ambassadors by virtue of their contributions to community efforts. That could mean helping write or edit articles, assisting with videos, performing website maintenance or development, helping with social media, or anything else that interests them. So to get started on the path toward ambassadorship, we should talk about how you'd like to begin contributing!

Dear Bryan
Yes, thank you very much, I would like to support you with the writing of articles and videos, I can also support you with maintenance and development.

Great, @psehgaft!

If you've got ideas for articles or videos, you can raise them on our [editorial](https://github.com/open-organization/editorial) or [video](https://github.com/open-organization/video) boards. There you'll also see ideas for articles and videos that others have logged but don't have authors or creators yet. Maybe something there will spur your creativity.

For development-related work, you might be interested in diving into our project website a bit. We centralize that work [on GitHub](https://github.com/open-organization/open-organization.github.io). But we're in the process of [redesigning the website](https://github.com/open-organization/open-organization.github.io) at the moment. @laura may have some guidance for you there.
