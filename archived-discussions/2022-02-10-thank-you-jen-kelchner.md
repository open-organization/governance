# Thank you, Jen Kelchner

As Jen announced on today's community call, she'll be stepping down as an Open Organization Ambassador this month. I didn't want to let this moment pass without acknowledgement of Jen's contributions to our community and our work.

Jen has been an Open Organization Ambassador since February 2017—though she began contributing to our work much earlier than that as a regular columnist. Her "In the Open" column [^1] was one of our community's first recurring series on Opensource.com. It's where readers were first exposed to Jen's passion for creating more humane and accessible workplaces. In those early days, she was also a familiar voice in #OpenOrgChat events on Twitter, where she was always ready with both a powerful, incisive quip and a timely, expressive animated GIF. Her contributions earned her an Opensource.com People's Choice Award in 2018.[^2]

As an ambassador, Jen has left an indelible mark on our project and our community. She was instrumental in crafting several documents vital to both our community identity and our ongoing work today—including the Open Organization Definition [^3] and Maturity Model.[^4] Her work is speckled throughout our book series,[^5] and she penned the introduction to the second edition of our Leaders Manual.[^6] And she has always served as an impassioned voice of our community, speaking at events across the world and bringing our work to receptive audiences in accessible and inviting ways.

Jen has not only contributed to our projects; she's also played a significant role in architecting our own community. She's participated in several evolutions of our governance model, ensuring we continued to grow and scale in ways that kept us aligned and unified. She oversaw the design, development, and implementation of a new community brand system (we didn't always look this good!). And she was the spark that ignited our most recent foray into video, as the catalyst of OpenOrgTV.[^7] In short: We are who we are today because of Jen's contributions in these (and other, too numerous to recount) areas.

Something I know I will always appreciate about Jen is her unrelenting aspiration and her persistence in driving conversations (occasionally difficult) about ways we can become a better—more open, more inclusive, more effective—community project. Jen is always seeking ways we can improve *how* we do what we do. On top of that, though, she always remains committed to ensuring we're crystal clear about *why* we're doing the work we're doing. I hope we can continue to embody that spirit of continuous improvement.

This transition means our community will need additional attention and assistance in areas Jen has been overseeing. In particular, we'll be seeking a new multimedia materials maintainer [^8]. Jen has graciously agreed to mentor anyone interesting in filling this role. If you're seeking ways to get more involved in this (or any other) effort, please do get in touch.

As per our governance documents, Jen will receive Ambassador Emeritus status, which grants her a standing invitation to future community meetings and events.[^9] She will also retain access to community fora, and I don't doubt we'll see her chiming into conversations every once in a while (I know I sure hope so). I wish her all the best in the promising work that awaits her—at Interchange [^10] and beyond—and am so very grateful for her contributions and her friendship.

For everything, Jen, I thank you! And I'm sure others will join me here in doing the same.
