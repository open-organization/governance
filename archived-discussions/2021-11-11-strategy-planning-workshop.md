# 2022 Strategy Planning Workshop
Bryan | 2021-12-16 18:40:20 UTC | #1

Every year, members of the Open Organization community gather for a workshop to take stock of the project,  generate ideas for new directions and initiatives, and articulate strategic priorities for the year ahead. Traditionally we've done this together in Raleigh as part of All Things Open. That hasn't been possible in recent years (though it's my hope that we'll be able to do it again very soon!). Last year, we experimented with a virtual workshop. We'll continue that experiment—refining our methods—again this year.

On a recent community call, Open Organization Ambassadors set some intentions and expressed some preferences for the session. I'm writing here to document them, to advance our planning discussion, and to keep everyone abreast of our plans. We can use this thread for general communication and discussion about the event.

You'll find [a workshop planning document and agenda here](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/evZW4eV2T025BSX3Y7a7RA?both). Everyone should feel free to review and contribute to it.

## Date and time

* January 10‒21
* Sessions scheduled at leaders' discretion

## Format

This year, rather than organize and host a *single* event comprised of multiple components, we're thinking of taking a more "modular" approach, doing a "workshop series," breaking the event into separate workshop sessions (each, say, ~75 minutes in in length) that run throughout a two-week "workshop window."

We will employ pre-recorded video to help folks prepare for the sessions, to engage one another across time zones, and to make the most of our collaborative time together.

All Ambassadors would be invited to all sessions but would attend only those they choose.

## Planned sessions

Ambassadors have suggested several compelling workshop sessions. See [our planning document](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/evZW4eV2T025BSX3Y7a7RA?both) for the full list of suggestions and please add your own!

### Evolving our governance model

👤 Led by Jen Kelchner
🗓️ Wednesday, January 12 at 8:00EST / 14:00CET
⏰ 75‒90 minutes
📝 [Pre-work required](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/K7u8glsuTMO2HkNF1Chb-w#)

Each year, we reflect on our project governance structure (and related documents) to ensure we’re organized in a way that best helps us accomplish our goals and truly reflects the kind of community we want to be. We’ll do that again this year, with special attention to updating the Open Organization Ambassador designation and associated processes.

### Imagining our target audience

👤 Led by Ron McFarland
🗓️ Tuesday, January 18 at 08:00 Eastern / 14:00 CET
⏰ 75 minutes
📝 [Pre-work required](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/uoe226TkS7-h2cTCldkAxQ?both)

Who does the Open Organization community serve? Who benefits from our work, who utilizes our materials, and who do we want to contribute to our ongoing projects? And are we doing everything we can to serve them? In this session, we’ll conduct a visioning activity to help us explore these questions. We’ll articulating our community’s “target customer” in a single, clear, and compelling statement and discuss how a shared understanding of this persona shapes our work for 2022.

### Building our contributor pipeline

👤 Led by Heather Leson and Bryan Behrenshausen
🗓️ Wednesday, January 19 at 09:00 Eastern / 15:00 CET
⏰ 75 minutes
📝 [No pre-work required](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/cbTRbAv-T3GyfrB0nusJvw#)

How are we welcoming new contributors with fresh ideas and insights into the community? And how are we preparing current contributors to be Open Organization Ambassadors? In this session, we'll answer questions like these as we survey our contributor pipeline and assess the various pathways by which contributors get involved in the Open Organization project. Our discussion will help us determine outreach and recruitment priorities for the year ahead.

### What does our website need to do?

👤 Led by Laura Hilliger
🗓️ Thursday, January 20 at 09:00EST / 15:00CET
⏰ 90 minutes
📝 [No pre-work required](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/FISDQH-ZRVa9EM7pL33vsg?both)

As we consider who are community is and what they need, we need to consider whether or not our community landing pages serve those needs. We’ll use this workshop to collect ideas and determine direction.

## Next steps

The workshop is always most effective when the people attending it help shape how it unfolds. To that end, you can:

- Comment on timing that does or doesn't work for you, so we can schedule accordingly
- Pitch a session you'd like to lead or co-lead during the event

I will volunteer to to coordinate planning, scheduling, and preparation as best I can (co-conspirators always welcome, of course).

I'm always energized by this work and hope you all are, too. I'm looking forward to seeing what we'll plan and achieve together.

After checking the meeting agenda, I've done two things.

1. I've added to the "15 words about audience" pad

1. I've added my name to this 2022 planning extravaganza notepad. I'd like to tie together the conversations on audience and marketing through our website – e.g. it'd be great if our website was more fit for purpose, whatever we discover that purpose might be.

I think it makes sense to do website planning AFTER almost everything else, and so I propose to hold a 90 minute session on Thursday, January 20th at 15:00CET. Session won't be techie, more conceptual so that everyone feel that our site represents us as a community!

Anyone want to be my partner in crime? 

Cheers!

Bryan | 2021-11-17 13:01:04 UTC | #3

Thanks so much, @laura, for putting this together. I think a website touchup is a perfect project for the new year.

In our planning document, I also linked to [our 2019 reader survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7Yrmv3V6fTnxPsz9Xy7tkDNb66YfOageeDMeMXN50U/edit?usp=sharing) for reference on audience data. A bit outdated at this point, but perhaps useful for historical context at the very least.

**Evolving Governance for Ambassador Program** 
January 12th at 08:00EST

I've compiled data to take a look at contributions, the impact of our work, and even our imbalances so we can have more clarity for this session.

I've made [a recording with slide share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXVk0wU318Y) here you can access and [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OIc0T0MLAPjn-YabHywqra7ywB-q0Olu3n08oU_B-SQ/edit?usp=sharing) here if you just want to look at the data.

Please feel free to async on the [Pre-Work document](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/K7u8glsuTMO2HkNF1Chb-w?both) with the section prompts provided until Jan 28th.

Friends, I'm very passionate about this topic (as you'll see in the video). Putting data to it and looking at our DEI issues, I'm eager to get input and craft a new way forward.

:)

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-01-04 19:39:24 UTC | #6

Thanks, @jenkelchner, for all your great work putting this together, and your insights to move us along. I think you've set us up for a productive discussion about community governance. I regret that I'll be late to the session but look forward to attending what I can.

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-01-10 15:00:12 UTC | #7

Today's the day! We're officially kicking off our 2022 strategy and planning workshop series!

Thanks to everyone who has helped prepare  for this event. We've got some great sessions on the docket. As a reminder: the series runs January 10 through January 21. See the opening of this thread for a complete rundown of all that we've got in store.

I get us started, I recorded a brief "Welcome and State of the Project" message. You will find it in [the custom YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIYDJHuxOkZFOwqdccZMmXnQQppwasUv) @jenkelchner has created for videos related to this workshop series—and at this link:

https://youtu.be/xc35fYTv3tM

Welcome, everyone! I'm eager to see what we'll plan together.

-------------------------

laura | 2022-01-12 16:30:03 UTC | #8

Hey! I was hoping to be part of the governance conversation, but 2pm tends to be filled with project meetings (and for some reason my January is not starting slow).

I want to thank @jenkelchner for voicing things that we've thought about and discussed over the years in her video and, likely, in the session itself. I've added to the pre-work/post-work hedgedoc, and [read the notes here](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/tZ6dbj7WSOCqRZOCLiH-OA?both#). May I ask if there were any next steps?

Also - I can't access the playlist for some reason, it says "this playlist doesn't exist", does it only work if you're an admin of the channel? I've watched Jen and Bryan's videos, but are there others?

-------------------------

jenkelchner | 2022-01-12 16:42:58 UTC | #9

The individual video links are being added in Discourse as well - which should make it more accessible.

I'm updating our work session notes as we speak and then will push it out along with the video link for the session today. There will be a lot of next steps and some async work -- coming soon!!! The conversation definitely struck different chords and raised additional questions but ultimately direction we can work with and vote on!

-------------------------

jenkelchner | 2022-01-12 17:02:12 UTC | #10

If you're here for the deep dive on the Ambassador Program and Governance, I've got you!

Start here and we welcome your personal input until Jan 28: [Pre-Work Doc](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/K7u8glsuTMO2HkNF1Chb-w?view) & [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXVk0wU318Y)

Thanks so much, @jenkelchner, for all the work you've clearly put into imagining, executing, facilitating, and documenting this session. I was only able to attend the final 30 minutes but what I heard was compelling, insightful, and productive. I'm eager to review the entire thing. Thanks to everyone who was able to attend and add their perspectives on this really important topic. Additional gratitude to everyone who has left their thoughts, responses, and impressions in the document Jen is curating. It's very rich.

Hello! I'm planning the "website" session off the back of everyone else's sessions, so I've been reading all your notes and am trying to make sure your session outcomes are reflected for our Thursday session. I've planned an agenda full of pretty colors to help us get stuff done. Agenda is updated [here](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/FISDQH-ZRVa9EM7pL33vsg?view). We will do a [journey mapping](http://opendesignkit.org/methods/journey-maps/) activity and use [a NOISE model](https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/noise-model/) to help us do some planning :)

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-01-18 19:19:59 UTC | #15

Can't wait! Thanks, @laura!

Thanks so much to @laura for today's awesome and productive session about our project website. If you missed it, you can catch up with the [notes](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/FISDQH-ZRVa9EM7pL33vsg?view), the [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1z_GEu4mEI5Gso3lZ0Du8xRrh9UpBUDtHSKHhiLWV0v8/viewer?skip_itp2_check=true&f=0), and an almost-full video recording ("almost" because I did not include everyone's personal updates, in case they did not want those broadcast). The video is rendering and will be available in the workshop playlist soon.

So great to see everyone who attended! These workshops have been a bright spot in an otherwise dreary week. But then again, you all always are.

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-01-21 17:42:53 UTC | #19

It's the end of the week, and that means it's the end of the Open Organization project's 2022 strategy planning workshop. So many thanks to everyone who not only participated in but also led sessions focused on our aspirations and goals for the coming year. I left every one feeling motivated, inspired, and excited about what's in store.

In case you missed something, don't fear! You can catch up on notes and session recordings. You'll find more details below.

### Welcome and State of the Project

- View the recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc35fYTv3tM

I tried to get us started by offering my own perspective on the current state of the Open Organization project and an assessment of the challenges that lay ahead.

### Evolving the Ambassador Program

- Watch the prep video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXVk0wU318Y
- Read the pre-work: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/K7u8glsuTMO2HkNF1Chb-w?view
- View the session recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu84FnWNm-M
- Read the session notes: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/tZ6dbj7WSOCqRZOCLiH-OA?both

@jenkelchner led a compelling discussion of the project's Ambassador role. How might we sharpen and evolve the role this year? How can we ensure it's providing value to those who occupy it? We explored these questions and more!

### Identifying our Target Audience

- Read the notes: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/uoe226TkS7-h2cTCldkAxQ?view
- View the recording: https://youtu.be/KHl_3NQH5Bk

@ronmcfarl walked us through an interesting thought experiment: Can we construct a single sentence describing the person/persona who benefits from the work our community does? Who is this person? What motivates them to seek us out and connect with us? And are we doing what we need to be doing to provide the value that person expects? Watch the recording to see what we came up with!

### Nurturing Project Contributors

- Read the notes: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/cbTRbAv-T3GyfrB0nusJvw#
- See the jamboard: https://jamboard.google.com/d/17WdvHKODqfsvyP1uOqflTRIBHIow6-ZRirz0o7Sg5_Q/viewer?f=0
- View the recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJJp3C0Ows

@heatherleson and I led a focused discussion on our community's "Contributor" role, examining the various pathways by which new contributors might join the project, and assessing our approach to inviting *users* to become *participants* in the Open Organization project. What are we doing to nurture participants who make significant contributions but may not aspire to community leadership roles? We all brainstormed some great ideas.

### This Year on OpenOrgTV

- Read the notes: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/LGB9hjtNTE6CyACBijVeOg?both

@jenkelchner invited asynchronous collaboration on our video strategy for 2022. No idea is off the table! What would you like to see us accomplish on our new platform this year? Chime in!

### What Does Our Website Need to Do?

- Read the notes: https://notes.theopenorganization.org/FISDQH-ZRVa9EM7pL33vsg?view
- See the jamboard: https://jamboard.google.com/d/1z_GEu4mEI5Gso3lZ0Du8xRrh9UpBUDtHSKHhiLWV0v8/viewer?skip_itp2_check=true&f=0
- View the recording: https://youtu.be/JX_Wn-OgR-w

To wrap us up, @laura conducted a session devoted entirely to our project website. We asked: Now that we understand more about our target audience and contributors, what can we say about the ways our website helps us address and welcome those folks? Is it serving them (and us) as best it can be?

### Next steps

Whew! What a sprint. But it was truly great. At next month's community meeting, we'll invite session leaders to offer recaps/postmortems of their respective sessions and help us understand how we can build on the productive momentum they've created. In the meantime, don't be surprised if you see new tickets, discussions, debates, and action items popping up on GitHub and Discourse. We've got plenty in motion!

Lovely to see you all, and best wishes for a wonderful 2022!

-------------------------

jenkelchner | 2022-01-24 15:31:32 UTC | #20

Hey everyone!  Just a reminder that I'm holding up your personal input on the Ambassador Program open until FRIDAY.  Then I'll be coming back to everyone with a report and next steps for setting new criteria for levels and contribution etc.

REALLY hoping to see your input this week!

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-01-24 15:41:58 UTC | #21

Thanks, @jenkelchner! I've enjoyed reading everyone's responses so far—very candid and insightful.

-------------------------

jenkelchner | 2022-02-24 18:36:54 UTC | #22

Hey, everyone.  I wanted to leave you with a brief summary here from the governance project as it is now back in your hands to pick up!

Thank you all for the opportunity to kick this important work off and best of luck identifying what is really important to the community moving forward.  Without more ambassador voices represented, it is hard to say the data show a definitive direction.  I recommend doing another type of request from each existing member to help identify a more clear picture. 

Up next would be:
1. Setting criteria for rolling off Ambassadorship
2. Setting criteria for activity and various types of contribution

Top issues to address:
1. Ambassador Contribtuion & Activity
2. Identify what Ambassador's (and potential Ambassador's) actually want and expect to be part of an Ambassador program 
 

Here is the [collated data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OlOpsPb8m_PsV0-BuQHW2kQ9t7kjNpTEzaoCjbZy8KI/edit#gid=1281444516) submitted by participants into a spreadsheet which can be analyzed further.  

You'll find the following HedgeDoc's for the whole scope:

[Evolving our Governance](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/K7u8glsuTMO2HkNF1Chb-w#)
[Workshop documentation](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/tZ6dbj7WSOCqRZOCLiH-OA?both)


See you all around sometime! :)

-------------------------

Bryan | 2022-02-25 14:20:28 UTC | #23

Thanks so much for your time and care with this, @jenkelchner. Your data are certainly valuable to us all as we continue to evolve our governance.

Incidentally, I can begin thinking and working more explicitly on:

> 1. Setting criteria for rolling off Ambassadorship

My first step will be to review your spreadsheet and the notes on this issue it contains. Then I will draw up some proposals from that material and initiate a separate thread to lay it out for review and discussion. Ultimately, I believe this will culminate in revisions to [core governance documents](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roles), which we'll review and vote on in due time.

Of course, anyone else interested in the issue of articulating "roll off"/"inactive status" criteria for Ambassadors is welcome to participate in the analysis and proposal, too!

-------------------------
