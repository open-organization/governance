# Redesigning the community project “plan”
HeidiHVL | 2020-04-28 17:25:07 UTC | #1

Hi Y'all,

While we are all working towards redesigning our Open Org Community, I thought I would sketch out the ideas and general "plan" (notice the quotes!)

## 1. Migrate website and other materials to new platforms
To prepare the community for evolution and growth, we'll need to ensure our platforms and materials are ready to support new contributors and projects. Some items here include:
- ~~Migrate all project materials to new GitHub home at ``github.com/open-organization``~~
- Build [a new website](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/building-our-new-showcase-on-the-web/123/8) at ``theopenorganization.org`` and migrate community materials to it
- Reassess Discourse site policies at ``theopenorganization.community``. Consider opening more sections of Discourse for general community interactions. @bcotton [suggests eliminating](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/governance/commit/babda60a1cd01e23392280d6703268f315966de0#commitcomment-38653382) ``openorg-list`` mailing list and moving all community conversation to Discourse for simplicity, greater inclusivity, and better coordinated discussions
- Migrate [to new Twitter account](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/our-twitter-handle/91/19) at ``@OpenOrgProject``

## 2. Update community description, charter and governance
As we evolve, we'll want to make sure we're aligned on a mission, vision, and charter that still speak to us. Some items here include:

- Continue [our discussion of the work](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/updating-our-project-mission-vision-and-description/125)
- [Comment on](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/governance/commit/babda60a1cd01e23392280d6703268f315966de0) and help improve [the working draft](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/governance/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md) of an updated charter

## 3. Define membership and participation details 
A clearer, more explicit outline of community roles and responsibilities would help us attract new members, contributors, ambassadors, maintainers—whomever else. Some items here include:
- Consider making a new document that outlines community "roles and responsibilities," to store in our ``governance`` [repository](https://github.com/open-organization/governance)
- Consider adopting a code of conduct

## 4. Define working terms-of-use for materials generated within community 
As we build new materials, it never hurts to revisit the open licenses we're using to ensure that they best communicate how we'd like others to use what we create. Some items here include:
- Audit existing materials to review licenses and provisions
- Conduct a community discussion about our vision for re(use) and (re)mix

## 5. Describe internal working relationships/intersections with OSPO, People, Open Innovation Labs, Brand, and other Red Hat teams
We'll take this opportunity to communicate our community evolution to teams inside Red Hat with whom we've worked in the past. This helps us clarify relationships, set some "rules of the road," and determine how we can all best work together.

## 6. Start a new project
We can also communicate our continued growth by orchestrating a new project. Some items here include:
- @Bryan proposed something like a "[Guide for Distributed Teams](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/potential-project-guide-for-remote-teams-distributed-work/129/4)"
- @HeidiHVL working on a series about "open management" 
- @laura writing a series tracking our evolution and chronicling lessons learned

So great to have all this in one place, @HeidiHVL. Thanks so much. I will try to add some thoughts and to pepper in the most appropriate links so we can build this out and maintain it as a living document to chart our path forward. Really appreciate it!

Thanks for this @HeidiHVL - I'll engage before our session next week.

Curious if our upcoming meeting on the 14th will be/can be more of a collaborative work session to review async work? Or, can we schedule a work session if anyone is interested?  It would be most helpful to coordinate and work on what we are wanting to bring about collectively and have actual engagement in decision making process. 

Thoughts @laura @HeidiHVL @bcotton ??

I can't be at the meeting (the RHEL 9 program call is the same time and the 14th is our official kickoff session), but I would support the idea of a working session.

Very much +1 :+1: the idea of some upcoming working group sessions, @jenkelchner. I'm worried that May's meeting agenda is [already pretty jam-packed](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/may-14-2020-meeting/127) with "let's sync on this" items and that we may not have as much time as we'll need to really dive into ongoing projects, etc. So what I'd propose is that at the meeting we make a point of identifying places where people would like to jump into something more deeply, who'd like to do it, what intended outcomes would be, etc.—and then consider some working sessions appropriately.

Just one approach, though. If you have other suggestions, please share!
