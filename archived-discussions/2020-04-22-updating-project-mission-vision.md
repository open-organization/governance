# Updating our Project Mission, Vision, and Description

Following @HeidiHVL's request for ideas on evolving our project and community in [another thread](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/our-future-ambassador-group-governance-and-focus-project/121/4), I wrote:

> One question that work raises is whether the document should continue to speak specifically about the **Open Organization Ambassadors** as a [particular group of core contributors](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/meet-ambassadors), or should speak to the Open Organization project and community as a whole, more generally (everyone who contributes, no matter the scope of that contribution). Your questions—“What does being an ‘ambassador’ mean? Who becomes one?”—are vitally important at this stage, as we think about community architecture and governance. In short: Ambassadors enjoy certain community benefits other contributors do not. How do we build a contributor pipeline that encourages more intermittent participants (folks who, say, have written a book chapter or submitted one or two articles) to “walk the path to ambassadorship”? Or is an entirely new community architecture in order here?

Since then, I have been thinking about how we might evolve our project mission, vision, and description to be more inclusive and community-centric. I've just finished a draft of a revised document on which I'd love feedback.

You [can find it here](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/governance/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md). And chime into [the discussion here](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/governance/commit/babda60a1cd01e23392280d6703268f315966de0).

Just a few notes on the draft and the thinking that led to it:

- You'll see that the document is now meant as a guide to The Open Organization _project_ more generally, not just the Open Organization Ambassadors _group_ in particular. The idea here is to stress that the Open Organization project welcomes contributions from anyone, and anyone with a demonstrated history of beneficial contributions and excellent collaboration can be nominated to become an Ambassador. This is my effort to lay groundwork for a more deliberate and explicit contributor pipeline.

- You'll see that the process of approving or objecting to Ambassador nominations becomes the province of all currently acting Ambassadors. That is, under the model proposed here, Ambassadors jointly discuss and approve new Ambassadors. I fiddled with an approval system I thought might be a good place for us to start; it's only an idea and I welcome alternatives.

I hope you'll have a look and participate in updating our core community documentation at the dawn of this new, exciting chapter of our group's history!

Many thanks to @laura and @bcotton for their feedback on initial versions of these revised governance documents. I now believe I'm ready to formally propose that we discuss them more broadly, with an eye toward ratifying them.

I've just opened a pull request suggesting updates to our community mission, vision, and charter. I've also suggested we create a new document outlining the various roles community members can play. I'd like us to continue updating that document as we allocate various responsibilities in in the project and community.

So it's all ready for feedback. I'll list all the proposed documents here, and encourage you to kindly have a look and leave some notes (either here, or in the thread on GitHub!).

- [Pull request and discussion](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/pull/8)
- [Proposed project and community description](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/cf68711b165f36fde9d5b25d27c731a61864b2e3/project-and-community-description.md)
- [Proposed community roles descriptions](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/cf68711b165f36fde9d5b25d27c731a61864b2e3/community-roles.md)

One additional note here that updated versions of our project and community governance documents are now live. In particular, you can note:

- [An updated project and community description](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/master/project-and-community-description.md)
- [An new document outlining various community roles](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/master/community-roles.md)

So the documents are easily accessible to interested contributors, @laura has helpfully added them to [our project wiki](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki), where we'll be showcasing the "live" and "ratified" versions of all these governance documents.
