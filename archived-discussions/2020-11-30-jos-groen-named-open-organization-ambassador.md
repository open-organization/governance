Following [a community vote](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/issues/13), contributor @JosGroen has become an Open Organization Ambassador.

A manager at [Axians](https://www.axians.com/en/), Jos has written about open management and leadership during an organization's transition from conventional processes and practices to open ones. He has written for [Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/users/jos-groen) and [*The Open Organization Leaders Manual*](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/blob/master/groen-transformation-leadership-hybrid-world.md), and will soon be the subject of the community's *Managing with Open Values* interview series.

Jos is also a seasoned speaker. In July, he [presented a webinar](https://www.redhat.com/en/events/webinar/how-to-drive-the-transformation-journey-through-an-open-organization-approach-2020) entitled "How to drive the transformation journey through an open organization approach." Jos is a prolific and well-connected LinkedIn user who uses the platform to engage with others on open organization topics. He has [volunteered](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/november-12-2020-meeting/172) to join our community's efforts to explore LinkedIn as a platform for community building.

Congratulations, Jos! We're excited to learn from you.
