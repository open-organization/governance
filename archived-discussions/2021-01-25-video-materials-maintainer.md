# Video materials maintainer
Bryan | 2021-01-25 18:39:50 UTC | #1

Following the exciting (and productive) discussion of new media initiatives from our [2021 strategy workshop](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/establishing-production-process/192), I've been thinking more about how we'll scale our editorial efforts as we prepare to add video to our publishing repertoire. And I've been thinking we might benefit from someone in a leadership position specifically devoted to ensuring our video efforts are consistent, coordinated, and aligned with the community's editorial goals.

So I'd like to open a discussion about creating some kind of "video lead"â€”someone who essentially does what I do for our printed work, but for videos. This might include responsibilities like:

- Setting editorial strategy and enforcing editorial standards
- Liaising with creators, supporting them, and keeping them on track
- Maintaining an editorial queue of work-in-progress
- Ensuring consistency and quality of published materials
- Scheduling publication of new work
- Communicating about published materials with the community and with our social media/promotional teams

... and so on. The description and specific responsibilities matter less to me than the overall goal: really, this is someone who can help us guide the video efforts to success in whatever way that's necessary.

In line with [our current governance model](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Community-Roles), perhaps this would be someone like a "video editorial maintainer." To help establish some precedent for this role, I could document the editorial work I do into a description of something like "print editorial maintainer," so that's "on the books" as well. That way, we begin the work of more formally establishing and documenting the community's various leadership roles.

Because she has been such a strong proponent of this project so far, I'd like to nominate @jenkelchner  for the role. But I of course want to clear this space for additional discussion, response from @jenkelchner , etc., before we all commit to anything. I'm curious to hear what others think.

I would definitely want to look at and then modify as appropriate the process you use @Bryan. I think since several of us are keen to start using the medium of video to share thought content, I'd love to hear from others before we proceed to me taking on the role.  

If everyone is all good by early next week, I'll accept this and make it into something...it's how we do around here right :)

Sure thing, @jenkelchner. I will make a note to document my editorial role and incorporate it into [the governance docs](https://github.com/open-organization/governance) this week. That gives others a chance to chime in, too. Thanks for considering!

I happily second @jenkelchner's nomination. Would also <3 to work together to make sure our Github is fit for purpose and/or uses labels and links to bounce people to the right places :)

You read my mind, @laura. Thank you for offering to help here. :pray:

Today I plan to do two things:

- Formalize/finalize the revisions to [the production process we outlined](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/establishing-production-process/192/3), then
- Formalize/finalize a description of the "print maintainer" position I suppose I occupy, so we can use it as a template for video.

So if you've got more feedback/input on the production process, please don't hold back.

Per my earlier note of intention, I've now [written a description](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Community-Roster#maintainers) of the "print materials maintainer" role and published it in our governance wiki. Useful, perhaps, to @jenkelchner as she mulls the opportunity, but also hopefully useful to others as we experiment with this governance model.

@Bryan  -- does this align?

Responsibilities include:

* Establishing editorial direction for multimedia content materials
* Ensuring video and other multimedia materials move successfully through the editorial process
* Reviewing work from [Ambassador] creators of multimedia materials; editing work as needed
* Preparing multimedia materials for publication
* Coordinating release of multimedia materials with other materials maintainers
* Coordinating announcement of multimedia materials on social media
* Working with [Ambassador] creators to publish work in the Open Organization YouTube channel
* Maintaining the Open Organization YouTube channel

Looks perfect to me, @jenkelchner. And of course, like any community role, this one is always open to continual revision, change, flux, and flow as we better understand our needs and this person's responsibilities. This, however, is a great starting point.

I'll take when you've written here and incorporate it into our community governance documents.

Hooray! Thanks so much.
