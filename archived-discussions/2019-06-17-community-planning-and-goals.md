## Community outreach/new forms of engagement

- Can we replicate the experience of that roundtable we did for Open Organization Week at Red Hat? (Angela) _Related: What can we do that leverages audio, which is becoming a more frequent method by which managers, etc., are consuming content? (Jen)_
- “Advice from the Ambassadors” column for 2019 (take questions from readers and have one or two ambassadors answer those questions at regular intervals) (Rebecca) // _(Jen) - I had experience with this while at Forbes Councils in terms of the format we used and could provide insight/context if we explore this format._

## Content focus and priority

Diversity, inclusion, and equality is big on our minds. To that end:
- Can we produce materials specifically aimed at minority/under-represented groups? (Laura)
- It would be interesting to connect this to digital divide and localization (Heather)
- Seems that we’re all into neurodiversity / neural modifications, maybe we should do something in this space (Laura) (+1 from Jen)
- I’ve had a lot on my mind about how inclusivity and other words are triggers and create blocks. This leads to talks about open discourse and expanding the way we think. (Jen)

## New resources we might generate

- Some resources on how to effectively influence and intervene to drive more openness (Rebecca)
- Resources for open and human-centered design projects (Heather)
- Resources for applying open principles in non-traditional “open” organizations (Heather)
- Are we issuing a new/updated book in 2019? (Bryan)
  - Do we need to rethink and update the Field Guide? (Bryan)
  - Do we need to update the Workbook? (Bryan)
- Can we think about a “Guide to Inclusivity” pamphlet or other resource that collects work from the above-mentioned focus on diversity and inclusion? (Bryan)
  - Maybe this could be a new type of offering? A small, more topic-focused handbook or pamphlet?
  - Could think about Guide to Inclusivity, Guide to Education, etc.

## Community infrastructure

- Do we (can we) have a budget for travel? (Heidi)
- Do we need a new real-time communication channel? (Bryan)
- Can we update [Red Hat’s Open Organization landing page](https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book) to be more community-centric? (Bryan)
