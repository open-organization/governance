# Understanding who we serve
Bryan | 2022-02-11 18:00:27 UTC | #1

*(Posting on behalf of @ronmcfarl, who is leading this effort.)*

As part of our [2022 strategy planning](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/2022-strategy-planning-workshop/266/21), we've been diligently discussing our perceptions of *who the OpenOrg project serves*. Thanks to Ambassador @ronmcfarl, we've noodled, written, discussed, and debated our way to a unified statement describing this user persona.

@ronmcfarl has compiled work to date [onto a Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/198yB6MLiA0D1NHtcEKAIg5LMymPyd6QX82gBHj21brs/edit?usp=sharing) we can review. He'd like us to polish our unified statement describing our user persona.

For instance, @ronmcfarl has offered:

> “Open Org mentor wanted”:  We mentor individuals and executives to broaden their physical and virtual network to build and collaborate with allies, to increase sustainable innovation and spark joy for the common good. (29 words)

And he's asked others to review the description alongside [the workshop outcomes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jH7ii9eEsoU5lxBErzkSbyG0SIfgx5aUhSI27Vdayts/edit?usp=sharing) and float their own descriptions. We can use this space to do that.

I was re-examining the slides today and thought I'd try to draft something. Here's what I came up with:

> We help leaders guiding change on their teams and across their organizations—people who understand that building a more innovative, engaging, sustainable organization may require rethinking the organization's culture, structures, and processes. These leaders seek practical advice and resources for sparking and managing these changes, as well as a network of like-minded advocates with whom they can share stories, locate support, and test ideas. (63 words)

In my usual work helping organisations and teams create their purpose, mission, and vision we differ between four parts. I think maybe why I struggle with one sentence is that it might try to combine all things into one which to me either becomes too wordy or too washed down. My approach would be something along:

PURPOSE (why) 
**Purpose guides you.** Your purpose statement articulates why you do what you do, why  your organization exists. 

> To mentor leaders and communities creating better collaboration and happier organizations.                                                                          

MISSON (how)
**Mission drives you.** Your mission statement is how you accomplish your purpose. Your mission is what drives you every day to fulfill your purpose.

> Something something Open Organization and Open Leadership

VISION (what)
**Vision is where you aspire to be.** Your vision statement is what you will experience and achieve in the future, the results you are reaching for, the measurable impact you want to make. Vision keeps you on course, to fulfill your purpose. Our North Star/True North.                                                                  

PERSONAS (who)
(Heather)  “An open advocate”: they seek mentorship, tactics and allies to suppor their open journey.
(Bryan) “An organizational leader”: they are looking for ways to spark the kinds of internal changes that will help the organization become a more dynamic, inclusive, innovative, and sustainable place to work and grow.
(Laura)  “Non-profit, tech/transformation beginners”: They were thrown into digital and want to learn quickly. They need easy & practical tactics.
(Ron) "Industrious Bob":  They want advice in starting and executing on a common good project that requires several people and skills to be successful.
(Jimmy) “Better collaborator”:  People who want to lead and collaborate in a better way than the hierarchy world.
(Jos) “Top Executive”:  Conventional Joe: curious how Open can elevate creativity, value creation and joy to his organization and what it ask from him as a leader and the team. Both as professional and human. Makes the Org sustainable, more profitable and attractive to talent. Looks for practical guidance to create the needed culture.
(Ben) “External networker”:  “A person that wants to network in a wider area than his specific organization.”

Thanks for this, @Jimmy. I really like the architecture you've laid out here. I wonder what @ronmcfarl thinks?
