# Updating community ambassador role

In her [recent analysis](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/2022-strategy-planning-workshop/266/22) of our community governance structures, @jenkelchner noted that we've not clearly defined criteria by which Open Organization [Ambassadors](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roles#ambassadors) "step down" from their roles and transition to [Emeritus](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roles#ambassadors-emeriti) status. So I've created this space for discussion about whether and how we might update our governance documents to include something like this.

Using @jenkelchner's [excellent research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OlOpsPb8m_PsV0-BuQHW2kQ9t7kjNpTEzaoCjbZy8KI/edit#gid=119531504) as a guide, I will lay out some of the fundamental issues below, just as a way of setting the table for discussion.

### The issue

While we've identified a clear [process by which contributors become ambassadors](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roles#becoming-an-ambassador), we haven't defined a process by which ambassadors transition *out* of this role. The most we say is:

> Ambassadors pledge a minimum commitment of one year. At the conclusion of their respective terms, ambassadors will discuss plans to renew or complete their commitments.

Historically, the "exit process" typically involved me (@bryan) asking ambassadors annually whether they would prefer to continue in their roles or step down before another term began. That tended to work in those early days, when I was really just doing what I thought best to ensure that the team remained unified and people felt both engaged and appreciated for their ongoing work.

But we have evolved so much since then, and as we’ve evolved I’ve felt more and more uncomfortable being the "sole arbiter" of ambassadors' status—that is, acting as the single person who’s having that conversation with people about their community contributions.

In practice, this has meant that ambassadors only become emeritus members when they voluntarily change their roles because they feel they'd no longer like to occupy them.

### The implications

The effect of this largely *ad hoc* and voluntary process is that we've never needed to establish concrete, shared criteria that determine whether an ambassador retains this role at the end of the specified period. I think we should change this.

### The purpose

I feel our goal should be to collectively establish the criteria by which an Open Organization Ambassador *retains* and/or *relinquishes* their role at the end of an agreed-upon term. This way, the community can simply appeal to these criteria when updating [our roster](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roster) to differentiate active ambassadors from emeriti.

Criteria like these would allow for transparent, non-confrontational conversations regarding communal expectations for contribution. More frequent conversations about community contribution also allow us to more deliberately "check in" with everyone to ensure that we're doing work that excites, benefits, and engages everyone.

### The idea

Having read and reviewed folks' thoughts and preferences to date, here's what I would propose:

* We review [the community roster](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Roster) every **six months** (or whatever period we all determine). When we do this, we open an issue in the [governance repository](https://github.com/open-organization/governance) to initiate discussion about upcoming roster review and potential revision.
* We review the current roster and determine who (if anyone) has not met the criteria for "active" status during that period. **We will need to define these criteria, and that will be a significant facet of this undertaking!**
* We take the folks who haven't met these criteria (if anyone) and tag them in the discussion in order to open a dialog with them about their intention to remain an Open Organization Ambassador, their desire to "roll off" to Emeritus status, and their contribution goals for the coming month.
* We check back with them in a month to see if they've met the contribution criteria. If they haven't, we transition them to Emeritus status.

There's probably a more effective way to do this! I'm open to hearing ideas.

### The criteria

As noted above, outlining this process will require specifying the criteria for "active" ambassadorship. I'll list some ideas below, just to get the conversation going. Ultimately, I'd like multiple current Open Organization Ambassadors to define these criteria collaboratively.

An active Open Organization Ambassador is one who:

* Contributes at least {XX} written pieces (articles, book chapters, interviews, case studies, etc.) or {XX} video pieces (episodes, tutorials, reviews, roundtables, etc.) in six months, or
* Contributes at least {XX} social media assets (posts, graphics, conversations, etc.) in six months, or
* Participates in at least {XX} collaborative projects (larger-scale community initiatives) in six months, or
* Manages at least {XX} community project or initiative in six months

Again: I'm just listing ideas, trying to account for multiple types of contributions, attempting to be as inclusive as possible so we're not overburdening everyone while at the same time articulating minimal responsibilities. I don't necessarily have a preference (yet) on proposed criteria.

I'm keen to hear what others think.

As discussed in the previous sessions, it's difficult to set "hard" criterias (meaning setting the numbers). However, there might some consensus in the reviews? We also need to further work with the topic that also came up on what the benefit for being an Ambassador and what is the commitment from the organisation to the individuals?
