# Our future: Ambassador group governance and Focus Project
HeidiHVL | 2020-03-24 11:09:22 UTC | #1

Hi Ambassadors,

First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are doing OK, considering the global pandemic and its effects on our work, personal lives, and communities. My thoughts are with you all.

I'm really excited about our community's next phase, which we discussed at last month's Ambassadors meeting (if you missed it, you can check out the notes and the recording (https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/march-12-2020-meeting/115/4). So I wanted to start a discussion about what we might do next, and how we might grow.

As we design our future and take advantage of new opportunities being supported by the Open Source Program Office, I see two priorities at the moment: revisiting our community identity and governance, and discussing short-term and long-term projects for the Ambassadors specifically.

Here are some of my initial thoughts on those issues:

**Community governance**
Specifically, let’s start with our group, the Ambassadors. What should core contributors like us hope to gain by participating in the community? What do we need and want from it? And how can we self-organize to meet those needs? How do we want to contribute, and when? What does being an “ambassador” mean? (Who becomes one? etc.) I think [revisiting our group charter](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md) might be a good way to begin this work. Does that document still capture who we are and what we want to be?

**Future projects**
What thoughts do you have for working on a community project? Traditionally, we might have been working on a book in the Open Organization series (a long-term project), or be writing weekly articles (short-term projects). We can only continue doing those things. But I'm also curious to hear what else you think we should be doing, if anything. Maybe we can brainstorm on what collaborative project we want to do next! What topics interest you that you feel other Ambassadors would contribute to? What are you working on that you would consider expanding or opening to collaboration? Are you drawing a blank? Then consider: do we want to update some community materials? Address managing in the context of COVID-19? Contribute to a focus on Open Management (I’m creating a series of articles)?

I thought I'd start a thread to launch this discussion. I’m looking forward to hearing what you have to say! If you'd prefer to chat one-on-one about anything here, feel free to reach out and schedule a conversation.

Best wishes, 
Heidi

Hi Heidi,

I have now read both The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project books.  They both are in story or novel form with key characters, troublemakers and all kinds of drama in the turnaround of an auto parts company .  I have prepared notes on them and would like to give suggestions on how we as Ambassadors can follow in that same story format but with Open Organization Principles sprinkled in them.  I'd like to discuss this at our next meeting.

Hi Ron,
Thanks for the reply. I'm curious to get a little more detail on your thoughts for the meeting.
I've read The Phoenix Project too and I remember it being about the importance of DevOps in IT -- basically that IT was really the backbone of a business and not the service, product or whatnot that was created in the past. 
Can you give a little outline on what you are thinking to suggest? Are you thinking to create a project based on a similar narrative? Or were you thinking to use lean methodologies in our governance model? 
With some clarity, I can organize the conversation accordingly. 
Best wishes,
Heidi

Thanks so much, Heidi, for kicking off this important conversation. I'm so glad you did. We're faring pretty well here in Durham—staying distanced as much as possible in compliance with our local government's stay-at-home order, though admittedly beginning to feel the effects of that distancing.

Which is why I'm happy to be able to respond to a thread about future directions, plans, and possibilities! I think the twin priorities you've identified for us are **spot on**. So I will add some of my own thoughts on those priorities, as you've outlined them.

## Community governance

I like your suggestion of revisiting our collaboratively written community description and charter—because we need to ensure that it not only represents who we are *right now* but also speaks to the kind of contributors we want to see join the community *in the future*. I think of the [Ambassador Program Description](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md) as a kind of "manifesto" for our core project contributors; as such, I think it should speak not just to our identity but also to the work we'd like to undertake together (much as it does now, incidentally!).

One question that work raises is whether the document should continue to speak specifically about the **Open Organization Ambassadors** as a [particular group of core contributors](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/meet-ambassadors), or should speak to the Open Organization project and community as a whole, more generally (everyone who contributes, no matter the scope of that contribution). Your questions—"What does being an 'ambassador' mean? Who becomes one?"—are vitally important at this stage, as we think about community architecture and governance. In short: Ambassadors enjoy certain community benefits other contributors do not. How do we build a contributor pipeline that encourages more intermittent participants (folks who, say, have written a book chapter or submitted one or two articles) to "walk the path to ambassadorship"? Or is an entirely new community architecture in order here?

In the nearer term, at least, I'd like to begin removing from the description those references to Opensource.com, as we prepare for a move to our own home in the month ahead. I can start working on that and submit a pull request for everyone to review (more soon, when I have it).

## Future projects

I've been thinking about this a lot, too (it's like I've been cooped up in the house for an extended period of time or something). I thought the following might be cool directions to pursue.

- **The Open Organization Guide to Remote Work.** I'm imagining this as something like a "mini-book"—perhaps five or six key chapters on working openly while you're on a distributed team, or how working openly can help teams work *better* when they're distributed. It's timely, it's sure to be read, and we've already got some great articles in the archives we could dust off to form the foundation of the work. Something like this allows us to step out boldly, post-transition, to reassert our presence and expertise and enter into an ongoing conversation. Besides, I'm sure many of us are thinking through remote work best practices right now, and with openness at the forefront of our minds.
- **Better opening the book series.** I've always wanted to see the *Open Organization* book series becoming more like a collection of living volumes—artifacts updated regularly and more incrementally, rather than once every year or so. At the moment, contributing to the books is difficult because the files we've shared on GitHub are "binaries" (they're PDFs and ePubs), and can't be easily forked, modified, changed, etc. So, for example, if a reader found a typo and wanted to fix it, that reader *should* be able to go to the repository, pull the file for the appropriate chapter, fix the typo, and push the changes back to the book. Right now, it doesn't work that way. That contributor needs to note the typo in an issue on GitHub, then one of us (and honestly, usually me) has to go into the course files, make the change, and push new book proofs. It's slow, it's not inclusive, and it's not really how true open source projects work. I'd like to launch an initiative to better "open the books" as truly collaborative artifacts. Another project on which I'm working in the Open Source Program Office, [The Open Source Way](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook), is doing this in a really excellent way. I'd like to adopt some practices from that community.

I have more to say but also want to take a walk with my wife, and at the moment the walk wins.

Hi! Apologies for taking FOREVER to jump in on this conversation. After a chat with @HeidiHVL yesterday, I was inspired by an idea we had - namely, starting a new series about "Rebuilding our community". We were talking about how communities live and breathe and how we'd like to make sure that this next phase of our community helps us address some of the social credit issues we've been dealing with, as well as providing a kind of pipeline for those of us who need...something a bit different than just social credit.

[This is just a start](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyFocblLUXkEapSAsj4iYM5r5Dbo6Q3iqQ3BmOyphIo/edit#), and I'm already stuck. It feels icky and weird to start talking openly about some of the issues the community has been dealing with. 

[I also put this on the editorial board](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/editorial/issues/53)

Inviting everyone in on this one ;)

Thanks, @Laura! I left you some preliminary feedback. Will write more as I think on it. Excellent brainwaves to get us started.

hey hey - @HeidiHVL @Bryan feel free to edit directly! More than happy to make these less first-person and completely community written :slight_smile:

I can't make it to the meeting tomorrow (and I'm very annoyed by this, thursday is now my worst day). Just wanted to braindump a little.

I  made some suggestions, but I like the general direction.
