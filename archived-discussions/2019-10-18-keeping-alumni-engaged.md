# How to keep alumni engaged
Initiated 2019-10-18

(Not sure if this counts as chit-chat. Feel free to move it if appropriate).

At dinner on Tuesday night, the conversation turned to how we can keep our ambassador alumni (emeriti?) engaged. There are a few reasons we would want to keep former ambassadors involved:

1. We like them and they still have good ideas to contribute
2. It makes it easier for them to see what's going on and maybe write an occasional article
3. It makes it "safer" to make a clean exit from the program instead of just sort of fading away (in that people see being an Ambassador as part of their identity and they don't want to give it up, even if they can't fulfill the obligations of the title anymore)

I had a very similar conversation on Sunday in the Opensource dot com Community Moderator meeting. Here's what I came up with:

Ambassadors get (as an example. I'm not committing Bryan to anything):
* An all-expenses paid trip to fabulous Raleigh, North Carolina for All Things Open
* Cool limited edition Ambassador swag
* Access to the private areas of Discourse
* Priority editorial access
* The ability to use the Traveling Open Org Booth™
* Bragging rights
* etc, etc, etc

Ambassadors Emeritus get:
* Access to the private areas of Discourse
* Invitation to join the Ambassador meeting and various dinners if they happen to be in the neighborhood

Normal folks get:
* Access to the public areas of Discourse

This assumes some things that don't yet exist, but gives a general idea. We might come up with some requirement for emeritus status (e.g. you have to be an ambassador for 2 years), but I think giving the program a structured approach like this improves the networking benefit for current and former ambassadors and makes it easier for folks to step down when live changes.

Thanks for starting this important discussion, @bcotton. I really enjoyed hearing (and found quite useful) your insights on this issue at dinner in Raleigh.

I'm in favor of the idea—pending, of course, more precise articulation of the rights/responsibilities of the roles, input from others, etc. Our timing here is good, because we'd also discussed the prospect of revising and updating the [Open Organization Ambassador program description](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md), and we could make this work part of that overall project.

If we go that route, then I'd want to conduct further discussion on GitHub so it's more widely accessible.

I ++++1 Ben on this structure and all that we covered at dinner. I want to value and keep others engaged even when they roll off for whatever reason, AND, keep a clear role/message for Ambassadors.

I added this as a topic of discussion [at our October 24 meeting](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/october-24-2019-meeting/84)!

I'm sorry our time for this at the meeting got cut short, @bcotton, because I was hoping to have you lay out the above context and rationale "live" so others could listen and weigh in. Ambassadors are just so dang busy and insightful that hearing what everyone  was up to required the lion's share of our time.

But I'm wondering about next steps here.

I'd assume it's best for language about "emeritus" status to appear in the [Ambassador  program description](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md). Do you agree? If so, would you like to start working on the language that might appear there? We can spin up an issue on GitHub is so.

Yeah, we're a chatty bunch. :-) I agree that it makes sense to be in the program description. The only question is do we want to include it a broader revamp or do the emeritus edits first and then do the rest?

I'd be happy to take a first pass at a rewrite and create a first draft pull request that we can comment on. Or we can gather ideas first and then write a draft. Whichever you think is best.

## Bryan Behrenshausen

I'm inclined to do this work as a separate step, the precursor to a larger document re-write to arrive before the end of the year.

If you'd like to take the first crack on GitHub, then please don't let me stop you!

First draft submitted as [PR #4](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/pull/4)

Great, @bcotton! I'll take a look.

Tweaked, pushed, merged, and [updated at Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/ambassadors-program), @bcotton! Thanks for your great work on this.

Next week, I will email all newly designated ambassadors emeriti to notify them of the status change and invite them to join Discourse if they'd like.
