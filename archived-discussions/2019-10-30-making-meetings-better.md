# Making our meetings better

In a [comment](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/ambassador-program-description/pull/4#issuecomment-547854385) on my emeritus proposal, @jenkelchner raised a concern:

>  My hesitation is mainly around the fact we who are present don't have enough time to share and dig into actual Ambassador work as it is. And we only have about 25-40% of us online during said meeting. Perhaps this is just a different issue to discuss.

As usual, she's right. I enjoy our meetings when I have the ability to attend, but it seems like we're not always able to make good use of the hour we have available to us. One idea that comes to mind is to skip the status updates. We can put those in the meeting doc, but not discuss them unless there's something specific that needs to be discussed. This saves more time for open discussion topics (e.g. the emeritus idea which we were going to talk about in the meeting but ended up having to do asynchronously instead). Another approach would be to set a firm limit (two minutes, e.g.) on status updates and move to the next person.

I feel like a lot of times, the status updates fall into the "meeting that could have been an email" category as we all get very excited talking about the ideas we have. But there's not necessarily a lot of *conversation* around those, which suggests it's not the right approach.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE our updates (for the most part) but...@BCotton is right. I would really enjoy getting to talk about all the things that really matter about the conversation we are creating and driving. Our Sunday Session in Raleigh was very valuable in how we looked at driving the conversation and engagement moving forward.  

PLUS...if we use Discourse right and continue to engage in this format, our monthly updates will be far less needed in a meeting setting.

I've also been thinking about this lately @bcotton, and I'm really glad you started this discussion (this **discourse**, if you will). As the community has grown and evolved, so too has the purpose of our monthly meetings, and I really welcome this opportunity to have a discussion about maximizing our time together each month.

When we initiated monthly meetings several years ago, our primary purposes were *sharing* and *networking*. The group was new, young, and seeking direction. And I intentionally scheduled ambassador updates at the beginning of the meeting to symbolically put "ambassadors first" on the agenda (rather than, say, begin every meeting by launching into an editorial update). At the time, the group was approximately five people big. Updates required about 25‒30 minutes.

Clearly that's no longer the case! And yet we've left that meeting structure largely intact over the years.

Now, ambassadors are much more deeply embedded in various projects around the world, so thorough updates require more time. Like @jenkelchner, I love them, but also recognize that we now have many more communication channels than we did in the past—meaning more avenues for sharing intermittent updates outside the once-per-month cadence.

At the same time, our community *itself* has much more monthly business to discuss—a book series to grow and maintain, events to plan, policies and procedures to refine, strategies for growth to debate, and more. Perhaps the valuable face time we're able to achieve once per month is better spent on matters that would benefit more from dialog and synchronous discussion.

So I'm inclined to revamp the whole thing, depending on folks' preferences. For starters, I might recommend moving ambassador updates to the *end* of the meeting to occupy time *remaining* after we've taken care of the month's more pressing business. If this were the case, we wouldn't go "around the horn" but rather just let ambassadors with updates raise their hands to offer updates. We'd front-load items that ambassadors felt benefited more from dialog.

This discussion' timing is fortuitous, because [next month's meeting](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/november-14-2019-meeting/92) will already be unconventional. I've invited [Matt Thompson](https://twitter.com/openmatt) (formerly of Mozilla, now of [Work Open](https://workopen.org/)) to join us and provide an overview of his current work. So we'll allocate the lion's share of our time speaking with him. Then, in December, we can pilot test an all-new, all-different meeting structure.

How does that strike everyone?

+1 @Bryan -- sounds like a plan!
