# LinkedIn Account—Page
Initiated 2020-07-09

I'm interested in your opinions and contribution to setting up a LinkedIn Page for our Community.  This would be to showcase our collective work and support the credibility and reach of our content/thought leadership.

I'll happily take on the initial set up of the page and can add other ambassadors who would like to be Admins of the page.  This will give our upstream community more professional cred as well.

Thoughts? Comments? Anyone want to be an admin with me?

Bueller? :slight_smile: 

I'm not a LinkedIn user so I'm afraid I won't be any help as an admin, but I'm always happy to talk platform strategy, etc., as we think about spinning this up. And I'm eager to learn from the more ardent LinkedIn users among us.

Since I don't use LinkedIn, I'll have naive questions like:

- What do we do there? What do we want to do?
- What kind of value do we want to provide on the platform? What are our intended outcomes (i.e., do we publish stuff, generate conversations, offer links to resources, point people to community-run platforms like this one or GitHub)?
- What kind of engagement do we need in order to maintain a presence there?

Answers to questions like that are probably obvious to people more familiar with the platform, but I've found they're always worth discussing at the outset of a venture like this.

HI I use Linked in quite a bit. Did you want to talk about this? My schedule is now more open as covid response is less taxing.

Hey Heather! Great to know. I'm getting ready to head out on a holiday until mid-August. Would really love to collab with you on strategy - for right now, I was just going to get our page established.  Shall I add you as an admin on the page as well so you can jump in and do your magic too?

Hi all,

I'm interested in developing and maintaining the LI (LinkedIn) presence on behalf of the group. In fact, in full transparency and perhaps jumping the gun a bit, after Aug's community meeting, I went ahead and created the organization on LI. I didn't publish anything yet because I wanted to get an understanding from the group on a few things: 

1. Strategy: What will we use it for? I see LI as a "professional Facebook" where we would announce and disseminate information about our community. 

2. What is our messaging? I was thinking that we would share announcements on our Open Organization publications (articles, books, podcasts), news, accomplishments, etc that are specifically Open Organization stuff

3. Would we share specific things from ambassadors that are not specifically created for the Open Organization? I'm guessing no because that is what personal LinkedIn accounts are for. 

Anything else? Thanks everyone! 

Heidi

I'll remove this from my task list then :) Cheers! 

You may want to tap Heather Leson she was interested in the topic.

Glad to see this taking shape. A few additional thoughts from me.

I'm always in favor of finding target-rich environments for all the great writing everyone is doing (and resources everyone is making). I don't know much about how LinkedIn works. Would we just curate a "river of news" there, linking to our articles as they're published so others are aware of them and "click through" to read them? Do we actually repost/syndicate our material on LinkedIn—create modified versions of already-published pieces and post them there (I seem to recall that LinkedIn prefers "original content" posted on its platform)? Create discussion groups around the work, for greater interaction? Just trying to getting a better sense of "what happens on LinkedIn."

Related to this, for me, is the question: What is the goal of spinning up a venue on LinkedIn? Do we want to increase traffic to Opensource.com articles? Get more people to engage with us on Discourse? Get more people commenting on LinkedIn itself? I understand the first-level goal of "connecting with a new audience." But I guess my follow-up question then would be: Once we've connected, then what?

> Would we share specific things from ambassadors that are not specifically created for the Open Organization? I’m guessing no because that is what personal LinkedIn accounts are for.

As we currently do with Twitter (via retweets, etc.), another option is to use the OpenOrg LinkedIn mechanism to amplify what community members are doing (re-share their personal LinkedIn posts, etc.). Just something to consider there, too.
