# Our Twitter Handle
Bryan | 2019-11-08 19:25:11 UTC | #1

At All Things Open (more specifically, over beers at our post-conference dinner), @jenkelchner raised the possibility of altering our community's Twitter handle. I'm creating a space for us to continue that discussion here.

## Context

Historically, the open organization community has tended to congregate on Twitter. Conversation typically follows the hashtag #TheOpenOrg. 

The community's "official" account (which announces new releases, engages with supporters, promotes ambassador activities, etc.), is [`@OpenOrgBook`](https://twitter.com/openorgbook). It's an artifact from the community's genesis in Jim Whitehurst's *The Open Organization*, which launched in 2015. The Open Organization is no longer a single book by a single author, nor is it simply a community-driven conversation *about* that single book. Should our Twitter handle reflect the growth, maturity, and broadened scope of our work?

## Suggestions

If we *were* to change the handle, what might we choose? Add suggestions below. **Note that the official character limit for handles is apparently 15 characters.**

- ~~`@OpenOrganization` **(available immediately)**~~
- ~~`@OpenOrganizations` **(available immediately)**~~
- ~~`@OpenOrgCommunity` **(available immediately)**~~
- `@TheOpenOrg` **(claimed but abandoned)**
- `@OpenOrgMatters` **(community submission)**

## Additional considerations

- Should we get "verified"? How do we even do that?
**(Note that verification is currently closed for new accounts)**

Let's start with verification:  It isn't always easy to get approved, although, this is one channel that actually has a shot. Twitter is weird (shocking) about who it verifies and logic doesn't apply despite the req's. Here is a quick blog overview- last year they were at a stop for receiving any additional verification requests. That could have changed.

Handles:  I think it is important or we will continue to have "book" in our name rather than community of awesome people that we are.  Suggestion to add to the handle list @Bryan is simply @theopenorg -- it should sync up to our hashtag and that is also a nice upswell of data. If not, my vote is the first or third.

Great resource! Thanks, @jenkelchner. I did consider `@TheOpenOrg` but, alas, it appears as though someone has [already snagged it](https://twitter.com/theopenorg). It's clearly unused and abandoned; however, I'm not sure how to engage the process of claiming an abandoned handle.

Just an update that I've scheduled a meeting with Red Hat's social media experts in order to discuss ramifications and unseen consequences of a handle change.

I will also ask about:

- Getting verified
- Feedback on new handle options
- Reclaiming an abandoned handle (since this team successfully reclaimed `@RedHat` this way)

If anyone else has questions, simply add to the list and I'll be sure to raise them with the team.

Thanks @Bryan -- I feel like this was the tone of your answer... hahahaha :slight_smile:

Not at all, @jenkelchner! I'm glad you raised the possibility of reclaiming abandoned handles.

We also have a friend of the site in Remi DeCausemaker who might be able to help us get verified from the inside. That said, I don't know that verification gets us very much, other than some better tools for handling the masses, which isn't really a problem we have at this point.

I agree we should move on from the book association. Of the suggestions above, `@OpenOrganization` is my favorite. `@TheOpenOrg` is good, if we can get it.

Thanks for the excellent input, everyone.

I've had a meeting with my team's social media experts. They're able to help us transition to a new Twitter handle seamlessly, if and when we're ready.

A few other points of note:

- They recommend *not* moving forward with a "matching pair" for handle and hashtag (`@TheOpenOrg`, `#TheOpenOrg`). They suggested this might help us avoid some confusion on the platform. However, 
- If we decide that we really do want to go after `@TheOpenOrg`, then they will connect me with someone at Twitter to discuss the possibility of recuperating/reclaiming an abandoned account.

They also recommended I prepare our followers for a potential change by floating a poll, which I think is a fun and useful tactic.

And since I had the opportunity, I asked them their opinions. They like `@OpenOrganization`!

FYI - that poll (when I took it) of 33% Meh's really speaks to people needing educated on the community, our purpose/mission, and the need from engagement (which we covered in our meeting in Raleigh). <3

Agreeâ€”and precisely the reason I think a Twitter handle refresh is long overdue! Hope to complete it soon.

Quick update on this project.

I've had productive meetings with my colleagues in the [Open Studio](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/open-studio). With members of our crackerjack social media team, I am working on registering a new handle and making it our new, official account. We have representatives at Twitter with whom we work closely, so we can do this quickly, painlessly, and with no hit to our followers.

The frustrating news?

`@OpenOrganization` is *one character* over Twitter's official character limit for handles. I tried registering it, but to no avail. I'd settled on that one after hearing feedback and preferences for it, and because it removes "The" from our handle more definitively (thus reinforcing the communal tone of the project and making it seem less exclusive and "singular," etc.). So now we try again. Additional suggestions welcome (I know we have a pool at the beginning of this thread).

At the same time, I'm working with my design team colleagues to create some new graphics for our Twitter profile. It's drab. It's always been drab. I think it's time for a refresh. And re-launching with a new handle is a great time to do that.

Not much on this chilly Friday, I know, but slow movement nonetheless.

In light of our current shifts... should we, could we... explore:

@openorgproject 
@openorgcomm. (never mind, I see it was struck out in full length)
or variations of??  Since it is going to be beyond books and blogs in resources?

-------------------------

Bryan | 2020-04-09 15:20:08 UTC | #14

I *really* like ``@openorgproject``. A lot.

-------------------------

jenkelchner | 2020-04-09 15:20:37 UTC | #15

YAY!  Maybe that will tie into the new brand that is being cooked up?? This switch into "project" which is more encompassing??

-------------------------

Bryan | 2020-04-09 15:23:52 UTC | #16

I agree. And I used that title in [my suggested re-write to the charter](https://github.com/semioticrobotic/ambassador-program-description/blob/master/ambassador-program-description.md), too. I think it reinforces precisely what we should be reinforcing right now.

Would love to hear what others think. If we think we'd like to move forward that way, I'm happy to reopen my communication with our social media team to get things rolling again.

-------------------------

Bryan | 2020-04-16 15:00:40 UTC | #17

Just a follow-up here that we now own and control ``@OpenOrgProject`` and I've begun working with our social media team (and, by extension, with Twitter corporate) to get our account history transferred here. Because Summit, this will take some time. _But_ we are once again on the way. Thanks @jenkelchner for the suggestion.

-------------------------

Bryan | 2020-04-17 12:28:27 UTC | #18

And another follow-up that I've been given a tentative date of May 11 to begin the process of transferring our materials to the new handle.

-------------------------

Bryan | 2020-05-21 17:05:35 UTC | #19

Quick note that you may notice a few changes to our account, [effective today](https://twitter.com/openorgproject)!

Won't it look even better with a new logo and brand? :slight_smile:
