# A 2021 Strategy Workshop
Bryan | 2020-11-12 22:16:13 UTC | #1

At the [November meeting](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/november-12-2020-meeting/172/2) of the Open Organization Ambasadors, I expressed my regret that members of the communtiy couldn't gather in person for All Things Open (held virtually) this year. That event has been not only an opportunity for all of us to reconnect, reacquiant, and celebrate our achievements, but also a time for some sustained planning for the year ahead (recall fondly our [2016](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/october-25-2016-workshop/41/2) and [2019](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/october-13-2019-workshop/83/4) meetings!). I underestimated just how much I'd miss that time this year.

So I proposed conducting a scaled-back workshop remotely this year. I know it won't be the same, but it may be something.

I'm floating the idea here to gauge interest in doing something like this. I know full well that everyone is just feeling *tapped out* this year. Yet another meeting-by-camera may not be the least bit desirable. I certainly acknowledge and respect that.

But if enough of us feel like we'd want to spend some extra time together, giving our project and community its annual tune-up and getting it road-ready for 2021, then I'm certainly open to it.

In particular, at today's meeting I heard several proposals for topics we might cover at a workshop.

### Community mission and vision
As @ronmcfarl  noted today, continually revisiting our community's [mission, vision, and basic governance](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki) is never a bad idea. The world changes, placing new demands on us and affording us new opportunities, and the nature of our work changes as a result. Moreover, as community membership ebbs and flows, we should seize opportunities to tap new ideas from various members, who could shape who we are and where we're headed. So that's something we could discuss at length at a workshop.

### Social media plans
Several folks (@HeidiHVL, @jenkelchner, @JosGroen) are plotting [our community's debut on LinkedIn](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/linkedin-account-page/144/8), which would be a new social meda venture for us. At a workshop, we might discuss our goals for operating on LinkedIn and our strategies for achiving those goals. Additionally, we could broaden the scope of this discussion to talk about our social media strategy more generally (at the moment, we operate [primarily on Twitter](https://twitter.com/openorgproject), and I maintain the account, but I am about as far from a social media expert as someone could get). So we might discuss the ways we coordinate and leverage our joint activity on social media in general.

### New media ventures
For quite a while, we've also been kicking around some great ideas about expanding the scope of our work outside the printed medium—beyond articles and books to something else, like a podcast or video channel. A workshop would be an ideal time for detailed discussion of (and planning for) something like this. Without a doubt, something like this would represent one of the Open Organization project's largest leaps in its five-year history. It would be an exciting discussion, but also one that required the kind of coordinated time a workshop would offer us.

So just a few ideas. I am open to anything else! I'd hope that our top priority would be jointly crafting a workshop whose agenda represented things we *all* wanted to discuss and plan, so I remain open to feedback and input of all kinds.

This could be something we plan at the end of the calendar year (2020), or something we decide is better suited as a new year kickoff (January 2021). Or as I said earlier: not at all, if it's too much.

Please give it some thought and chime in if you'd like.

Why don't we plan a workshop for mid/late January? We can plan 2021 in 2021! Then we have a bit of time to get a proper agenda together, schedule a block that works for everyone, and hopefully people come back feeling a bit more motivated and ambitious (talking about myself y'all!).

I'll bring the post its! (Image: This is a screenshot from a recent Pre-mortem we ran. We have been using Jamboard for strategic stuff lately, and it's simple and good. )

Thank you, @laura, for first and foremost maintaining the important tradition of bringing the stickies!

I like this plan, especially because it gives us a little extra time not only to plan the event itself but also to brainstorm our overall vision and goals for the meeting so we make the most of our time together.

If possible, I'd like to get the event scheduled and "on the books" by the end of 2020 so that we can spend the bulk of our time planning and preparing (rather than juggling calendars). So to that end I can try to put together a list of possible dates and float it. I'm assuming weekdays are preferable for all but I do not mind including a Saturday, just in case that miraculously works best for the majority (or "usual" meeting has traditionally occurred on a Sunday!).

I'll target the "back half" of January and we can begin there.

Please see the poll below. We'll start by selecting a date, then move onto setting a time. I'm imagining that our process will look something like this:

- Select date for the workshop
- Determine goals for the workshop
- Outline loose agenda for the workshop
- Determine how much time we'll think we'll need for that agenda
- Determine best time frame for the workshop (through a poll)

If you vote on a date, then your vote on a time preference will carry more weight when that time comes. :slight_smile:

I'm sure we can push this forward at next week's meeting.  It looks like there are some Tuesday/Wednesday options we can get behind. It would be nice to see if we can get @HeidiHVL to weigh in as well - for the core contributors to be on the call including @ben.openwaylearning and @bcotton.  

I had a chat with @laura and we'd like to offer (possibly) to architect the plan for the meeting so we can maximize our time spend and hit those high-level goals we have had for the last couple of years.  

thoughts?

I think this is a great plan. I've added a discussion to the top of our [agenda for this month's meeting](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/december-10-2020-meeting/175). Would love to finalize a date and time so we can begin the work of planning.

Absolutely. I'd hope that the eventual agenda for a strategy workshop would be a collaborative effort with input from everyone who plans to attend. I know you and @laura have some excellent exercises for leading productive and insightful planning sessions, and I'd certainly love to make use of them!

Okay! If I am reading this correctly, it seems like we've got some preference for holding the session on **Tuesday, January 19**. Great!

It also looks like we'd prefer to build a session that explores the following:

- Community mission and vision (revisit our charter and set direction)
- Community social media (report on LinkedIn and discuss overall outreach and engagement strategy on social media, including Twitter)
- Community media expansion (discuss podcast/YouTube plans and related strategy)

Given this, I'd suggest something like 3.5 hours, including adequate breaks, to really explore/engage these issues. So if folks agree to this scope, I can begin looking at calendars and attempt to locate the best time for everyone who's expressed interest in attending.

How does this sound to everyone?

What a great day!

I'm sure we'll collaborate on a full recap soon. In the meantime, I did want to offer some links:

- [The workshop's slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t_oyH9YxM-BKLfX7HGeBFto3p926C6uSuAW-egWHmYo/edit?usp=sharing)
- [A recording of the workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xvzLKTxPV11_RxFX5gHDUzo_GKSY9f4u/view?usp=sharing)

Unfortunately, I *think* I'll need to "unlock" access to certain resources for those interested in seeing them, but I have no problem doing this for anyone interested.

In the meantime, @laura did the very important work of capturing many of the questions and action items we established [in our project's governance issue tracker](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/issues)—so dive in there and add your feedback if you'd like!

Thanks to all who attended and offered their thoughts, energies, and intellect. We're poised for great things in 2021.

## Notes on strategy meeting
January 19, 2021
@ronmcfarl 

I just viewed the meeting recording, and here are some notes.

### "Lead On", "Contribute to", "Want to make" stickers

1. Although I'll help wherever needed, I enjoy creating and writing articles related to Open Organization Principles. Mostly, they come in the form of book reviews with my own business experience and Open Org Principles added
2. I could be interviewed on articles written to generate interest.
3. I could work on slides to give webinars on articles written to generate
interest.


### Our vision

I think something like "Who we are" and/or "What we do" might be good. It is similar to what Ben mentioned: "Why."

### Media suggestions in articles

1. In articles posted, put in info graphs in the windows instead of repeating parts of the text.
2. Make audio sections throughout the articles to highlight certain points.

### Audio-visual media suggestions

1. Have audio/video interviews of articles written to generate interest. (previously posted or new articles)
2. Have audio/video panel discussions are articles written to generate interest. (previously posted or new articles)
3. Create webinars with slides and presentation material. After webinars for posting on website (previously posted or new articles)


### Editorial board

I think that should be used by only one person (Bryan). Other members can view it to see what's going on though (need link for viewing). If there is more than one person making edits some confusion could occur.

### YouTube channel

I think it would be great if there was an Open Org YouTube channel, but here again it should be coordinated through one person to make sure consistency is maintained.

### Guard rails and common purpose

I think all activities should evolve around the five Open Organization Principles, whether for people within or outside established organizations.

### LinkedIn

1. Our content for LinkedIn should be prepared in advance and be targeted for anyone that wants to solve a problem and needs other people to achieve it.
2. The content must have some purpose or Open Org Principle.
3. The target audience could be (1) people within organizations now, (2) individuals that want to address a problem and build a community but don't have a specific organization now, (3) people that are exploring a company start-up, (4) people that have an organization and need partners, (5) people seeking some kind of employment. All these are LinkedIn viewers now.

### Added notes

1. I am now writing an article on sustainable economic development and where Open Organization Principles apply.
2. After that, I hope to write an article on how Japan is collaborating globally on development projects. Some companies are applying Open Organization Principles now which I'll present.
3. Then, after that, I want to write an article on how to encourage China to pick up Open Organization Principles.
4. I mentioned some time back about applying our [Communication Technology sheet](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/images/open-org/communication_tech_worksheet.pdf) to a CSM program for sales people. Could that be worked on this year?
5. I always hoped that some day, Red Hat Japan would start translating some of our articles and posting them on their website. Someone from Red Hat Japan must supervise it though. Is that possible and is there a budget for it?
