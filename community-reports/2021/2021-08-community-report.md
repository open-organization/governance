[In development since January 2021](https://github.com/open-organization/editorial/issues/67), the document now sits alongside the [Open Organization Definition](https://theopenorganization.org/definition/) as a practical guide for anyone seeking to create more open organizations. For more on the release, read the [release announcement from Laura Hilliger](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/the-open-leadership-definition-is-live/248) and view the [promotional video from Jen Kelchner](https://youtu.be/H43MfMGeV2c).

## Ambassador Notes

### Ben Cotton
I will be a panelist for "[Hold on loosely: project management for open source](https://eventyay.com/e/e7dfbfc4/session/7322)" at the Practical Open Source Information conference (online, 16 September)

### Jos Groen
After finishing my [series on talent management](https://opensource.com/users/jos-groen), I plan to create an e-book on this subject, along with possible podcast and video materials to support it. I will also prepare a  case study in transformational leadership (a story of transition from from conventional to open) and edit it for publication.

### Sam Knuth
I am revitalizing the ongoing discussion around a [series of articles on neurodiversity in the open organization](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/neurodiversity-in-open-organizations/44/18). My hope is to publish a couple of pieces myself in the short term, and then coordinate a few other authors. We are also discussing doing a live event or video recording.

### Ron McFarland

1.  I'm preparing a new presentation for OpenOrgTV, based on my article "[5-step plan to encourage your team to make changes on your project](https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/1/escape-the-cave)," which we published 26 Jan 2017. I've made a presentation entitled "Successfully starting projects," and I would like to review it with Bryan, as I would like to slant the presentation toward an open leader getting projects successfully launched using Open Organization Principles.  After adding his comments, I’d like to present it on OpenOrgTV.  After this presentation, I have other presentations that could be explored and
prepared.

2. **Future Open Organization Communities**: I have read the book [*The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism*](https://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/) by Jeremy Rifkin.  I would like to explore an article based on this book.  I have a lot of notes prepared for that article.  It will be mostly about Open Organization Community development, what Rifkin calls "Collaborative Commons."

3. **The Sharing Economy**: I am now reading [*The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27310516-the-sharing-economy) by Arun Sundararajan. Building these sharing business models will require using open organization principles.  I’ll make some notes and possibly combine this material and material from Rifkin’s book (#2 above) and put an article together, as they both are community development related.

4. **Other material**: I have read another seven books that could be used for future articles, [which I posted in July](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/the-july-2021-open-organization-community-report/244).
