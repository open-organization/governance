## Ambassador Notes

- @ronmcfarl  writes: "I'll publish my next article on January 03. It's about open principles' role in the future of work. The next two installments of that series are in editing. I've recently read the book [*The Age of Sustainable Development*](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Jeffrey-D-Sachs/dp/0231173156?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace) and will write about the role open principles will play in creating a sustainable future. I'll probably work on that in February. I've also read [*The Business Reinvention of Japan*](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Ulrike-Schaede/dp/1503612252?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace) and am considering writing about it—in particular, about the ways Japan has collaborated on many projects (and the role of transparency in those projects). My target date for that is March. At the moment, I'm reading [*One Belt One Road*](https://www.amazon.co.jp/One-Belt-Road-Chinese-Monographs/dp/0674247965?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace), and in April I'll likely write a review of the book that describes how open principles are impacting various infrastructure projects."
