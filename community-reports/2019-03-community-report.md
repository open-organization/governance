## {1} Editor's Notes

Welcome to the March 2019 Report! What a great month it's been.

In March, the open organization community at Opensource.com published five new articles, two of which came from ambassadors. Overall, our materials generated 15,090 page views, and volumes in the _Open Organization_ book series received 221 downloads.

The community is currently hard at work on several concurrent projects, including two curated article series. Read on to learn more about what the Open Organization Ambassadors are up to—and what you can do to get involved!

Editorially yours,
Bryan

## {4} Monthly Highlights

The open organization community is still curating two article series: one on "the open organization in education" and one on "the open organization and cognitive diversity." Anyone with something to say on either of these topics is most certainly invited to contribute. Reach out to Bryan or an open organization ambassador to get started.[1]

The "Open Organization Highlights" newsletter will make its triumphant return in April. Issued monthly, the newsletter will collect top articles from the Open Organization section of Opensource.com and offer readers additional resources for thinking about the ways open principles are reshaping organizational culture and design.[2]

"The We Are Open Co-op [1] has capacity, and we're currently taking on new clients. So if anyone needs help with just about anything involving open principles, edtech, culture, diversity, activism, storytelling, or just flat out brainy goodness, they're very welcome to shoot us a note.[2]"

Michael Doyle writes:

"I've got an idea of interviewing open leaders to talk about one time they faced an uncertain decision and how 'open' helped them work through it. I'll need to do one pilot to see if what I have in my head translates into interesting and useful content for the audience. The output format would be a video of less than three minutes in length. I've also been working on an article that was something I wanted to write about back in 2015; fortunately the content is still relevant. I call it the '6 keys to cross functional project success' and it is based on interviewing stakeholders and project teams from four cross functional projects that stalled."
