the most-upvoted of the DevConf.CZ 2021 lightning talks."

My [co-op](https://weareopen.coop/) and I are working with 10+ UK-based charities and using open principles along the way. My recent posts on [We Are Open Co-op's blog](https://blog.weareopen.coop/) share loads of juicy tips for organizing projects and people around digital transformation projects."
- @ronmcfarl  writes: "I have written an article on based on [The Age of Sustainable Development](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Age-Sustainable-Development-Jeffrey-Sachs/dp/0231173156?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace) by Jeffrey Sachs, which explores how open organization principles are playing a role. We are planning on how to post and present that material, possibly using some of that material for a presentation on YouTube. I have also read the book [The Business Reinvention of Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Ulrike-Schaede/dp/1503612252?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace) by Ulrike Schaede. I have just
written a draft article on it. Japan has had to make major business model changes over the past couple of decades, and open organization principles have played a role in them. Additionally, I have read reading [One Belt One Road, Chinese Power Meets the World](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674247956). I think open organization principles will help bring China more into the international community to solve global issues. I will start writing that article shortly. Finally, I'm thinking of writing about business 'stakeholders' and where open organization principles can be used. This is an issue that I have been thinking about for at least five years, as too many companies only respond to shareholder pressure for profits. I just learned of a book on this subject called, [Stakeholder Capitalism: A Global Economy that Works for
Progress, People and Planet](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Stakeholder+Capitalism%3A+A+Global+Economy+that+Works+for+Progress%2C+People+and+Planet-p-9781119756149), and just ordered it. I hope to read it within the next couple of months.
