## {1} Editor's Notes

What a month May was! The open organization community took Boston by storm, unveiling its first-ever conference booth experience at Red Hat Summit. We've also just initiated the next book project in the _Open Organization_ series.

Of course, amidst it all we didn't stop publishing. The open organization community published 4 new articles in May, and in sum our materials generated 13,812 page views at Opensource.com.

As we roll into the second half of 2019, we show no signs of losing momentum. Read on to see what the ambassadors have been up to—and learn how you can get involved.

Editorially yours,
Bryan

## {4} Monthly Highlights

* In Boston, MA, the open organization community hosted its first-ever conference booth in the Culture of Collaboration space at Red Hat Summit (May 7‒9). The booth experience allowed attendees to speak with Open Organization Ambassadors about their culture-focused organizational challenges, then peruse community-produced resources for addressing those challenges. Attendees could also register for the "Open Organization Highlights" monthly newsletter to keep abreast of community developments.

* The open organization community has launched its newest book project. Tentatively titled _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_, this new volume in the _Open Organization_ book series will feature materials educational organizations can use to change their organizational cultures and become more open. Roughly two dozen authors will contribute chapters.[1]

## {5} Looking Ahead

During the first week of June 2019, we'll be celebrating the fourth anniversary of the open organization community! Watch for a retrospective article at Opensource.com, an update to the _Open Organization_ book series, and more.

The _Open Organization Guide for Educators_ project has just reached its another milestone.[1] Authors interested in contributing chapters to the volume have submitted their first drafts, and book editors are now reading, editing, and offering feedback on all of them. Want to get involved? Just check out the project board on GitHub and pitch in![2]

The next meeting of the Open Organization Ambassadors will occur Thursday, June 13 at 09:00 Eastern / 13:00 UTC / 14:00 CET. We'll be hearing updates from all ambassadors in attendance, then catching up on some community news and planning. The agenda is open.[3]

"LDR21 has launched a non-engineer focused innovation lab for solving organization and culture change. This collaborative learning and solution-building environment is built on the Simplifying Change framework I've designed.[1] In addition, coming in July is a specific service launched to architect, build and scale org culture for startups and those in transition (post-merger/acquisition)."

"I'm busy learning about AI in no real depth as I skim the internet looking for just the right NP-complete problem. I'm also giving free ideas to e-mobility companies and helping people use exercises from the Open Org Workbook. If you've been following me, now is a great time to get in touch—I'm really soaking up new ideas at the moment, and we’re looking forward to learning why. Also, note that on Wednesdays the We Are Open Co-op has two 30-minute FREE slots for salutations and quick consultations. You can book one today[1] or check out how you can benefit from all the open expertise on our website."[2]
