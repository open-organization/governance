## {1} Editor's Notes

As we drift steadily past 2019's midpoint, we pause to recognize everything that makes our community so great. June is our anniversary month, and we celebrated in style. The open organization community at Opensource.com published four new articles and an updated book in June. And in all, our materials generated 13,549 page views at Opensource.com. We continued some amazing work on the next volume of the _Open Organization_ book series, and we reflected a bit on Red Hat Summit in May.

Read on to learn more about what's going on in the open organization community—and how you can get involved.

Editorially yours,
Bryan
