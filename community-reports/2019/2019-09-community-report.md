## {1} Editor's Notes

Fall is upon us here in the U.S., and this season of change will certainly be the open organization community's busiest. We wasted no time kicking it off, as we just published the newest addition to the _Open Organization_ book series, _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_. On top of that, our very first multimedia series is in the works, and our community is gearing up for the All Things Open conference in Raleigh.

In September, the open organization community published four new articles, and our materials generated 15,559 page views. Moreover, books in the _Open Organization_ series received 583 downloads.

Read on to learn more about the community's successes this month.

Editorially yours,
Bryan

## {5} Looking Ahead

- The October meeting of the Open Organization Ambassadors will occur October 24 at 09:00 Eastern / 13:00 GMT / 14:00 CET. Ambassadors are welcome to shape the agenda.[1]

- October will see the release of the open organization community's very first multimedia series. Chronicling the story of Open Organization Ambassador Laura Hilliger's impact at Greenpeace International, the series combines text, video, and audio to help audiences understand the power and potential of working openly. The series debuts globally on October 08.

- The Open Organization Ambassadors will convene for an in-person workshop on October 13 when several community members will be in Raleigh for the All Things Open conference. At the half-day event, ambassadors will conduct preliminary 2020 community planning and resource brainstorming. Ambassadors not in town for the event can still participate remotely, as we'll be broadcasting the entire event.[2]
