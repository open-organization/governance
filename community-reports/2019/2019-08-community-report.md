## {1} Editor's Notes

As summer drifts further into the rear-view mirror, we're preparing for our community's busiest season.

The open organization community published four new articles in August—and three came from Open Organization Ambassadors. In sum, our materials generated 12,792 page views at Opensource.com, and readers downloaded 170 copies of books in the _Open Organization_ series.

As we prepare for the final quarter of 2019—and the imminent release of _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_—let's take a moment to review everything we've accomplished.

Editorially yours,
Bryan

The Open Organization Ambassadors are preparing for the All Things Open conference October 13‒15.

The Open Organization community will also sponsor a booth at at All Things Open. Planning is occurring right now—and all ambassadors are welcome to shape the event. Find the notes (and ongoing discussion) on Discourse.[1]

The next book in the _Open Organization_ book series, _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_, is nearly prepared for global release on Tuesday, September 10. In fact, paperback editions featuring our amazing cover by Clara May and Ryan Williams are already available from publishing partner Lulu.[2] Be on the lookout for plenty of opportunities to help us promote the book and the amazing stories it tells about open principles' power to transform education!

Open Organization Ambassador Laura Hilliger will author a multimedia article series about her work helping Greenpeace International become a more open organization. The series—which will appear exclusively on Opensource.com and combine audio, video, and text components—chronicles a collaborative design sprint Red Hat helped Greenpeace conduct as it refines its plans for a global activism platform. The series will release on October 1 (with a "sneak peak" debut at TechExchange in EMEA on September 26, where Laura will deliver a keynote presentation). Ambassador Rebecca Fernandez will also appear in the series!

Jen Kelchner writes:

"I'll be leading an interactive workshop, 'Leave No One Behind—Knowing Your Citizen" at the 53rd ICA Conference in Bucharest the end of September.[1] This conference's theme is "Seamless Government—Anticipating Citizen's Needs,' and it will host approximately 75 CIOs from governments and other agencies around the world.

Additionally, I'll be speaking at the Red Hat Government Symposium [2] this November on the North American public sector book, 'A Government Leader's Guide to Culture Change,' published earlier this year.[3]

Looking forward to seeing folks at All Things Open!"

"I'm working with Aria Chernik to develop an Open Design program at Duke University. I'm also working as one of the 'Super Users' for the GoOpenNC effort (a way to get more North Carolina developing, using, remixing, and vetting open ed resources). I've begun work with seven schools in North and South Carolina to initiate the process of become Open Way Learning Academies (collaborating with the NC State Science House, Halifax County Schools (NC), and Coastal Leadership Academy Charter School in Myrtle Beach). I continue to provide Project Based Learning training to schools across the US through PBLWorks. I also helped with the NeXT[1] Summer Conference at Northeastern University last month. And I just finished editing _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_!"
