## {5} Looking Ahead

The next meeting of the Open Organization Ambassadors will occur on August 15 at 09:00 Eastern / 13:00 UTC / 15:00 CEST. Meeting notes are now available and ambassadors can edit them to add agenda items.[1]

Open Organization Ambassadors are preparing to converge on Raleigh for All Things Open 2019 in October. Ambassadors will attend the conference, participate in a community planning workshop, and staff the Open Organization booth on the expo hall floor, where they'll be able to discuss culture- and process-focused challenges with attendees.[2]

"I've working on a nuclear power decommissioning project here in Japan. That has got me exploring IV Generation Nuclear Power (advanced nuclear reactors). This research has been going for several years now. It is very much in an 'open organization,' information sharing forward between a lot of start-ups. I'm writing a case study on what I’ve learned so far."

Jen Kelchner writes:

"I created and led a Learning Lab pilot for a global organization's historic event held in Manila in June. The Learning Lab kicked off on Day 1 with a seminar-style introduction to the speed of innovation, open principles, and why transformation efforts are easier today than ever before. The 250 influencers (from 6 continents) who participated in the Lab returned on Day 2 and 3 to not only learn collaborative problem-solving techniques and how to cross collaborate—culturally and across channels—but also to learn, hands-on, how to model open principles and conduct learning communities. Resources used in the lab were opened so that each influencer could take the practices back into their marketplaces and communities. The Learning Lab hosted 250+ participants, 32 individual labs working on 19 different workplace-related issues, and boasted a ~90% met/exceeded expectations.

Feedback is still coming in, however, the consistent message is that the Learning Lab was the most impactful moment of the week-long Global Workplace Forum.

The real excitement for me was when participants wanted to know how to adapt open principles and practices for education, churches, and even mental health practice. I've always seen the true value of the principles of open being applied as a problem solver for human connection issues over technology building; but, then again my specialty is human dynamics. I believe the open-source community gave birth to a core set of values that can absolutely change the world and solve big challenges."
