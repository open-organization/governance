Ron McFarland writes:

"I had the pleasure of visiting Red Hat in Raleigh in November and got a feeling for its people and culture. I've spent much of my career in overseas sales training, working in many different countries. I would go to truck dealerships and teach them how to sell trucks. Eventually, I started to train those salesmen's bosses. And eventually, I was asked to teach general managers and owners responsible for supervising all departments at dealerships. When giving these seminars several questions kept coming up: Why should truck salesmen try to make the truck operators profitable? They just want to sell trucks. Why should sales manager train and help salesmen? They will just take those skills and knowledge and get a better job somewhere else. They should just ask them to sell as much as possible. Why should the general manager help each department manager to become more professional? They should just ask them to make money in their department. The reason they do the above is because by helping others become more professional, they themselves become more professional. On top of that, there is something else. It is not very visible initially, but behind the scenes, there is a sense of trust, loyalty and mutual support generated. That support is a powerful asset, but difficult to explain if you haven’t experienced it. Yes, some people have never felt that  'asset' and never will. It has been my experience that many have though and know exactly what I’m talking about. It is an organization of support. That sense of support is exactly the feeling I got when I visited Red Hat is Raleigh through the time everyone gave me. Although I am not an employee, I guess I’m a Red Hatter too."

Ben Owens writes:

"I am still working with a dozen or so schools and districts to get them to grow a more open culture as the foundation to enable more innovative teaching and learning practices to thrive (makerspaces, coding, project-based learning, mastery learning, etc.). In addition to my own book on Open Way Learning, the Open Organization Guide for Educators has been super helpful in this process."
