## {4} Monthly Highlights

* The Open Organization is traveling to Red Hat Summit with an interactive experienced designed to highlight how open principles change the way we work, manage, and lead! In Boston, attendees can visit the Open Organization community booth to discuss their culture- and process-focused organizational challenges—and learn how embracing open principles can help them tackle those challenges. Additionally, attendees can participate in a number of open organization-focused presentations in the Culture of Collaboration space in the Summit's Expo Hall.[1]

* The open organization community is currently at work on the next volume in the _Open Organization_ book series, tentatively titled _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_. The book—taking shape, like all other installments in the series, on GitHub[2]—will focus on the ways open principles and practices can help us re-imagine educational organizations. All are welcome to participate; first-draft chapters are due May 31.[3]

* The "Open Organization Highlights" newsletter is making its triumphant return! This monthly mailing collects community resources and delivers them straight to your inbox. Are you subscribed?[4]

"I attended a wonderful 3-day training in Napa Valley as part of the onboarding process to become a PBLWorks National Faculty member.[1] I was also part of the US Delegation to the Beijing Science Creation Competition in March (and will have a   blog coming out in a few days from EdNC on this).[2] I presented a workshop on Open Way Learning at the recent Innovative Schools Network Conference in Wisconsin Dells, WI. And as you know, my "Can Schools be Agile" was recently published at Opensource.com."[3]
