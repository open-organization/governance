"As LDR21 approaches its 3rd birthday at the top of the year, we have found ourselves in a new space serving the Public Sector CIOs and CTOs in NA and EMEA. With this shift in the last year, we are launching a rebrand and new market position on November 4th!  From a new brand identity, logo, and refined vision, we will now only focus on offering Digital Transformation Office services to change culture and processes and connect people with information and ideas (specifically to the Public Sector). In addition, we have begun working on/with Connected Communities efforts with municipalities Visit our refreshed site on November 4th for more information![1]

I'll be speaking at Red Hat Government Symposium on November 12th in Washington, DC in a breakout session on A Government Leaders Guide to Culture Change.[2] In this roundtable breakout session, Jen will focus on information flow, reskilling competency efforts, and embracing failure related to culture change. 

Our team who went to the 53rd ICA Conference in Bucharest, is now working to launch a Discourse community for this global members-only forum of CIOs and CTOs. In the next few months, we will kick-off this community, begin to add content, educate them on engagement with each other, and provide virtual working sessions on the topics covered at the conference.  You can now view the full report from the ICA Conference in September.[3]"
