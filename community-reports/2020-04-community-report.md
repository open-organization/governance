# The April 2020 Open Organization Community Report

## Editor's Notes

In April, the Open Organization project and community continued their transitions to new stewardship by Red Hat's Open Source Program Office. The transition involves exciting new infrastructure upgrades and development of a fresh logo and brand.

Read the rest of the report for more details—and to learn how you can get involved in important community activities.

## Community Publications

The Open Organization community published the following materials:

- Ron McFarland: [Book review: Nine Lies About Work](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/4/book-review-nine-lies-about-work)

## Monthly Highlights

- Open Organization Ambassadors helped staff the community's virtual booth at this year's Red Hat Summit, held exclusively online for the first time in the event's history. Heidi Hess von Ludewig, Laura Hilliger, Jen Kelchner, and Ron McFarland graciously met with Summit visitors to explain our community's purpose and work. Many thanks to them!

- Ambassadors Jen Kelchner and Ben Owens broadcast [a live conversation](https://ldr21.com/education-in-crisis-live-qa-04-17-2020/) about the future of education and the importance of an open approach to teaching and learning at a time when schools are operating remotely. A [recording of their conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7MdW6K-so) is available.

- The Open Organization project has a new home on GitHub: ``github.com/open-organization``. All community repositories have relocated to this location. Please update all relevant bookmarks and toolchains!

- Open Organization Ambassadors are discussing updates to community governance documents. Under discussion at the moment is [a pull request](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/pull/8) proposing a revised [community charter](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/cf68711b165f36fde9d5b25d27c731a61864b2e3/project-and-community-description.md) and descriptions of various [community roles and responsibilities](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/blob/cf68711b165f36fde9d5b25d27c731a61864b2e3/community-roles.md).

## Looking Ahead

- The next Open Organization Ambassadors meeting will occur May 14 at 09:00 Eastern / 14:00 UTC / 15:00 CET. An agenda is [taking shape and available for additions](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/may-14-2020-meeting/127). All Open Organization Ambasadors and Ambassadors Emeriti enjoy a standing invitation to attend.

- The Open Organization community is currently developing a new logo and brand system to better communicate its status as an upstream project. Red Hat's Open Studio is providing design resources. Throughout May, the community will discuss and refine its new aesthetic, and plans to debut the new brand in June.

## Ambassador Notes

- Laura Hilliger writes: "I'm [doubling down on activism](https://blog.weareopen.coop/this-50th-earth-day-activism-is-more-important-than-ever-b2edacbe5989) for Greenpeace and other clients through [We Are Open](https://weareopen.coop/). The Co-op is helping clients with open leadership, open mindsets, and open engagement. [Get in touch](https://weareopen.coop/contact/) if you need some open experts. I also recently [published a new book](https://leanpub.com/extremeopen), *Open is an Extreme*, and I'm working to ensure that the post-pandemic world is more equitable and collaborative than the world we've left behind."
