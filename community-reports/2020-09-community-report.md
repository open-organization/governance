# The September 2020 Open Organization Community Report

## Editor's Notes

In September, the Open Organization community published four new articles, launched a new website, opened the doors of its new community forum, continued work on a collaborative book, and welcomed some new proofreading help. Read the full report for all the details.

## Community Publications
The Open Organization community published the following materials:

- Sim Zacks: [Want to make better decisions? Encourage disagreement](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/9/make-decisions-encourage-disagreement)
- Heidi Hess von Ludewig: [Overcoming resistance to open management](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/9/overcoming-resistance-open-management)
- Sim Zacks: [Getting credit: Taking your place in a meritocracy](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/9/getting-credit-meritocracy)
- Ron McFarland: [What would a global open organization look like?](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/9/global-open-organization)

## Monthly Highlights

- The [new Open Organization community forum](theopenorganization.community) is now open. In September, Open Organization Ambassadors agreed to make the project's Discourse platform its default communication channel, reserving the ``openorg-list`` mailing list for occasional community announcements. Anyone is now welcome to create an account, read [our terms](https://www.theopenorganization.community/c/discourse-discussion-documentation/5), and engage with the community on Discourse.
- The Open Organization project's new website is now out of beta and **live** at ``theopenorganization.org``. Community members have been working on the new site since the summer, and are pleased to finally debut the project's new showcase on the web. Got feedback? Found a bug? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/open-organization/open-organization.github.io/issues)!
- Contributor @trncb has graciously agreed to [assist with proofreading](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/september-10-2020-meeting/149/2?u=bryan) community articles, books, and marketing collateral. We're delighted to have his help!

## Looking Ahead

- The next Open Organization Ambassadors meeting will occur on October 08, 2020, at 09:00 Eastern / 14:00 UTC / 15:00 CET. A [meeting agenda is available](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/october-08-2020-meeting/166) for attendee input.
- The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork accepted another [new chapter in September](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/blob/master/cotton-what-to-select.md)—this one from Open Organization Ambassador @bcotton. Three more chapters are currently under consideration for inclusion in the book's 1.0 release by year's end. Want to contribute?
