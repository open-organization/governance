# The July 2020 Open Organization Community Report

## Editor's Notes

The Open Organization community published two new resources in July, and continued work on its next book, *The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork*. Following a design sprint, the community also made significant progress architecting its new website.

## Community Publications

The Open Organization community published the following materials:

- Ron McFarland: [Globalization: A history of openness](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/7/globalization-history-open)
- Open Organization Ambassadors: [How an open project's governance model evolves](https://opensource.com/open-organization/20/7/evolving-project-governance)


## Monthly Highlights

- Work on the Open Organization project's next book continued in July. Last month, the community released a "preview version" of *The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork*, which is [now available for download](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/releases/tag/0.90). In July, the community continued accepting contributions to this book-in-progress. Please consider [pitching your own chapter](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/issues)—or even helping edit and proofread [the great work already submitted](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/projects).
- Construction of the Open Organization community's new website continued in July. Open Organization Ambassadors @laura  and @jonasrosland led a development sprint (website jam!) to move the work forward significantly. We now have a [staging environment and development branch](https://github.com/open-organization/open-organization.github.io/pull/1) where the new site is taking shape, and we welcome any and all feedback and assistance there.

## Looking Ahead

- The next meeting of the Open Organization Ambassadors will occur Thursday, August 13 at 09:00 Eastern / 14:00 UTC / 15:00 CET. The meeting agenda is [open for input and modification](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/august-13-2020-meeting/147).
- The Open Organization community aims to make even more progress on its [new website](http://theopenorganization.org) in August, with the aim of launching it before the fall. If you'd like to assist, please don't hesitate to join the effort. Review our ongoing [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/open-organization/open-organization.github.io) and reach out to anyone on the [community's web team](https://github.com/orgs/open-organization/teams/website).

## Ambassador Notes

- @ronmcfarl writes: "I'm working on drafts the second and third articles in my series on open organization principles and globalization. @Bryan and I are editing them both and cutting them down to a more reasonable length. Now, I'm exploring potential connections between innovation and open organization principles through history. I'm planning to have a draft of that in August."
