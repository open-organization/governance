## Ambassador Notes

- Laura Hilliger writes: "I've been doing some press on the [Greenpeace/Red Hat collaboration](https://opensource.com/tags/open-organization-greenpeace) and started capturing the URLs in a [Media Kit](https://www.laurahilliger.com/media-kit/) on my site. I've built this page especially for recent press after realizing that self promotion is my own responsibility (hence the term "self" promotion). I'm trying to get my website up-to-useful and I'm always happy for feedback from the open organization community."

- Ben Owens writes: "I've been working on an [Open Way Learnin Maturity Model](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jSWLfX5FKIjyJUQocL0yw9FcsL5t35A1GWEWDD6ipJw/edit?usp=sharing) and welcome candid feedback on it. Ambassadors may already be  familiar with the [OWL Model](http://www.openwaylearning.org/), so they might be able to provide insight as to how it could be used with schools or other organizations looking for ways to be more innovative, learner focused, and obviously open. Just note that the slides would not be used in presentation mode because it is admittedly text heavy, but rather in one-on-one or small groups after first familizaring folks with the overall concept."
