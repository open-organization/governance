# The March 2020 Open Organization Ambassadors Report

## Editor's Notes

Greetings and salutations, dear readers!

March was an historic month for the Open Organization community. We welcomed a new community sponsor, delivered a dynamite webcast, published new materials, and launched important discussions about the next phase in our community's evolution.

## Monthly Highlights

- The Open Organization community has a new sponsor at Red Hat: the [Open Source Program Office](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/our-community-contributions)! This community transition became official [at the March](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/march-12-2020-meeting/115/4) Open Organization Ambassadors' meeting. To learn more about the positive impact this move will have on the Open Organization community, [see the FAQ](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/open-organization-project-transition-faq/119).

- The Open Organization community was recently featured on "Community Central," an upstream-focused webcast from Red Hat's Open Source Program Office. Ambassadors Laura Hilliger, Rebecca Fernandez, and Allison Matlack presented the community's mission, vision, and history to an audience of roughly 350 viewers. Bryan flipped the slides. [A video recording is available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snf6vICDbzw).

- Heidi Hess von Ludewig is [seeking community feedback](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/our-future-ambassador-group-governance-and-focus-project/121) on two important issues: the Open Organization Ambassador community charter, and the next big project the community might undertake.

## Ambassador Notes

- Ron McFarland writes: "I'm working on new content related to *The Phoenix Project* and *The Unicorn Project* and how they illustrate open organization principles. I have lots of notes, which I would like to discuss at the next community meeting."

- Heidi Hess von Ludewig writes: "I'm continuing work on my interview series, 'Managing with Open Values.' Bryan and I conducted two recorded interviews so far, with a written interview in the works (with Ambassador Emeritus Angela Robertson!) and a third recorded getting scheduled. And we have two more scheduled after that! I'm currently writing the first article, based on our first interview from interview one. The second interview could be up to three articles in the series!"
