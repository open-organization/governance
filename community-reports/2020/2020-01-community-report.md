# The January 2020 Open Organization Ambassadors Report

## Editor's Notes

Greetings, happy new year, and welcome one and all to the first Open Organization Ambassadors report of 2020!

January was a quieter month for the open organization community at Opensource.com, as we emerged from winter hiatus to resume publishing on January 14. Nevertheless, the month saw three new articles (two from ambassadors) and 15,200 page views across all our materials. Volumes in the *Open Organization* book series were downloaded 336 times.

Read on to learn what the Open Organization Ambassadors—and the broader open organization community—were up to last month!

Editorially yours,
Bryan
