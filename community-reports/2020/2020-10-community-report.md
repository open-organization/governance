# The October 2020 Open Organization Community Report

## Editor's Notes

October was a busy month for the Open Organization project and community. We published four new articles and released an important update in our book series. Community representatives also spoke about the project at the All Things Open conference. Read on to learn more about our activities and initiatives.

## Ambassador Notes

I have also read Professor Lynda Gratton's book, [The Shift: The Future of Work is Already Here](http://www.lyndagratton.com/books/97/116/The-Shift.html) and written a two-part article on it and the importance of open organization principles regarding work in the future. Right now, I'm starting to read [The Age of Sustainable Development](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Age-Sustainable-Development-Jeffrey-Sachs/dp/0231173156?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace) by Jeffrey Sachs.  This could be a follow-up article to my articles on globalization."
- @Laura writes: "The We Are Open Co-op has been doing [loads of work with charities and public sector](https://blog.weareopen.coop/helping-social-mobility-organisations-in-an-emergency-pivot-to-digital-provision-381bc3a44395) helping them use open practices and design methodologies to think about their futures. It's been part digitalisation, part opening minds to new ways of working and everything about a sustainable, resilient future."
