It could be the subject of a follow-up to to my articles on globalization. Actually, it might also lead to a follow-up article on my article '[Climate challenges call for open solutions](https://opensource.com/open-organization/19/10/global-energy-climate-challenges),' published October 10, 2019. I should have a basic draft of this article finished in January, 2021."
