Meeting conducted via BlueJeans

## Special Presentation

Joining us at this month's meeting was  [Matt Thompson](https://twitter.com/openmatt) of [Work Open](https://workopen.org/), who provided an overview of his current research and work-in-progress. We engaged in a lively and productive discussion about open source communities, open organizations, "preconditions" for openness, and the similarities and differences between our projects.

In particular, Matt walked us through his list of five key "themes" or "muscles" for healthy organizations:

- Purpose (why)
- Agility (how)
- Empathy (who)
- Trust (emotional safety)
- Openness (transparency)

At December's meeting, we'll return to regularly scheduled programming!
