## Ambassador Updates

- Heidi: Guesses she published an article today? (She did. It's great.) Now working on an article about "customer empowerment" and what that means; how can businesses design and build empowerment structures (using Nordstrom as an example); how can we help people use their best judgement with as little risk as possible? How can we apply this to other types of industries (beyond retail)?
- Jen: (useful tip: https://conferencemonkey.org/), been staring at a computer for two weeks; nice to talk to people; bangs are on fleek ðŸ’¯; blockchain project delayed a bit (maybe beginning of May?); spening "an exorbitant amount of time" working on learning labs (16 hours on the phone last week alone, just explaining collaborative concepts); also putting together a repository of "thinking tools"; this will be open sourced/Creative Commons'ed; upcoming forum will be 800+ in attendance (200 or 300 through the lab); Interesting article to prove open and why now: [Top 10 Skills in 2019](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/the-hard-and-soft-skills-to-futureproof-your-career-according-to-linkedin/)

We're not sure); cloudgazing yesterday
- Jimmy: I'm awaiting a reply from the conference Agila Sverige in the end of April if my pitch of Open Organization will be accepted.
