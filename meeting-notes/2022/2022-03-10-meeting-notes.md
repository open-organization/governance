## Housekeeping

- Opensource.com is undergoing migration as part of a system upgrade. All publication is halted until March 15. The new system looks amazing (Bryan had a sneak peek) and it really shows off our materials well!

## Ongoing Discussions

### Updates to Ambassador description
Jen initiated a discussion about the Open Organization Ambassador role and Bryan [continued it on Discourse](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/updating-community-ambassador-role/316). What are folks' thoughts?

- Jimmy: Agree we should formalize this. The trick is defining the criteria.
- Ron: Really does not care about criteria (active/extremely active/inactive distinction doesn't really matter to him)
- Jos: Time tells us who is active and who isn't, so maybe our criteria needn't be too rigid

### Updates on single-sentence audience description
Ron has [floated some summary work](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/understanding-who-we-serve/283) from his annual planning workshop. Should we discuss?

- Ron walks us through the work to date. We review the descriptions.
- Invitation for folks to please review the discussion and add their thoguhts and impressions if they'd like.
- Open unlocks sustainable growth: it takes courage

## Project Updates

### Open Leadership Assessment
Heidi is leading construction of an [Open Leadership Assessment tool](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/WpPhqbJwRG2KzuEz5md8tQ?view). This tool will allow us to oeprationalize the Open Leadership Definition and have something to guide discussions and learning about open leaderhsip mindsets and behaviors.

- Work is ongoing and going well
- We're in the midst of drafting the language for the tool, which will all be open source
- Jos has current speaking/workshop opportunities, work for which might be useful to our project here (he will share)
- Jos volunteers to field test the assessment at his workshops (FYI Heidi!)
- Ron will read and comment on work to date

### Open Organizations, Open Societies
Ron offers a quick overview of [the book he, Brook Manville, and Bryan have been reading](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52342434-open), reviewing, and discussing.

- Ron's introduction to the book will be published March 15
- Brook is working on a two-part review that is currently in editing
- Ron is going to write another piece to bookend that
- Bryan will probably write something after that
- We will also likely do some kind of roundtable video discussion

Laura and Heather are writing the next issue of the *Open Perspectives* series. It's on social impact-focused open organizations.

- Laura and Heather now have a complete draft (yay!); Bryan is editing and almost finished with first pass
- Ron is working on new writing about open organizations and sustainable energy futures
- Ron sees overlap between these projects and would like to collaborate
- Possibility of video roundtable? Ron to read Laura and Heather's work and to assess, maybe prepare an interview session for OpenOrgTV.

### Leadership and Transformation
Jos is working on a series of writings and workshops on open leadership and organizational transformation. Some are book chapters, some are workshops and presentations.

- Working on a new book chapter (*Open Organization Leaders Manual*)
- It's a case study of a transformation initiatve Jos led at a previous organization
- It explains how open leadership principles and practices helped him guide an organization through transformation (from conventional to open)
- It's much more practical than his other writing (including the other chapter hee wrote for the book)
- This will form the groundwork for a more robust and extensive project in the future (expanded with additional tips and examples from others)
- Also in the works are video tutorials (three of them) for Red Hat; filming beguins March 29

### Website update
We're gradually crafting a new project website.
