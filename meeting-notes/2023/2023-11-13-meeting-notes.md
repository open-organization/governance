Really sorry to have missed you all. Thanks for the notes! Congrats on all the awesome work you're doing :smile_cat:

Hi everyone! I saw the note about Coaching Buttons (thanks!) and the question about copyright. I manage the Coaching Buttons site.

The copyright statement on the Coaching Buttons site is meant to reflect the website design, etc. Authors always keep the copyright for their articles published on Coaching Buttons - that's why we publish everything under a Creative Commons license.

If different wording about copyright would help, it's easy to update the website statement - let me know.

Anyone is welcome to share an article on Coaching Buttons. The site is focused on leadership and management topics - especially the open organization approach. [We don't run ads](https://coachingbuttons.com/advertising) and we don't do sponsored articles.

And the same is true for [Technically We Write](https://technicallywewrite.com/) for anyone who wants to write about writing. :smiley: 

I'd love to attend the next meeting and chat about it, but I'm speaking at a conference on Dec 14th. How about January?

Jim,
I'm thinking a posting an original article on Coaching Buttons.  All my articles give reference to at least one of five Open Organization Principles, namely Transparency, Inclusivity, Adaptability, Collaboration, and Community.  
1-Would it be OK to link my article posted on Coaching Buttons to one of those Definitions?  They are at https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-organization-definition/.  Then, we both can share in the value.
2.  Could we forward the article to The Open Organization and various LinkedIn websites?

Ron

I'm really delighted to see this conversation. Thanks, @jhall, for your continued engagement and support of the community, and @ronmcfarl for keeping this important conversation going.

Jim, love the idea of you attending an upcoming community call to "pitch" Coaching Buttons to the community. In particular, I think it would be useful for us all to hear about the vision and mission that animate the site, along with any kinds of editorial guidelines and/or "hot topics" you think the site will be covering. Naturally, we'll want to be sure that what we write is a natural and appropriate fit, editorially speaking.

Plus, more selfishly, it'd just be good to see you.

I understand that the 14 December meeting is a no-go. What if we were to change the date of the meeting to another day that week (for example, December 11)? Would that help?

### jhall | 2023-11-21 00:19:12 UTC

Hi Ron - Yes, that sounds like a great article! And no problem sharing the article in the Open Org and LinkedIn. All articles are CC and your copyright so you can do what you want with them after we run them on Coaching Buttons.

### ronmcfarl | 2023-11-21 00:22:31 UTC

Great Jim,
I'll send you a Google Doc Share of the article I'm referring to as an initial article, and we can talk about it.

### jhall | 2023-11-21 00:27:33 UTC

Hi Bryan - Thanks for the invite to the next meeting! I'd love to be there. I'm speaking at the [Government IT Symposium](https://fusionlp.org/govit-2023/) on all three days, so I'm unavailable then. But Friday 15 Dec should be free, all day. I have some time on Monday 11 Dec between noon and 2pm (US/Central time).

I'm all about an open community at Coaching Buttons, and I'd love to have lots of folks contribute articles there. The range of topics is pretty broad, anything that fits "leadership" and "management" - especially using a "lead from within" (i.e. "Open Organization") model.

### Bryan | 2023-11-28 14:13:19 UTC

Thanks, @jhall! I've moved the meeting to **2023-12-15** to accommodate your schedule that day. Looking forward to seeing you.
