## Project Updates
Apologies to people who were unable to attend, we are unable to record and will thus try to take decent notes. Thanks Laura for helping out, taking notes! Thanks Bryan and Heidi, for formatting all the things :)

## Infrastructure updates and notes
- Red Hat IT is retiring Listman (external mailing lists hosted on listman.redhat.com) and will use Google Groups for external mailing lists by Aug 30. This affects our mailing list openorg-list@redhat.com and the archives at https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/private/openorg-list/.

### Discussion
Do we need a mailing list? 
- Bryan is in favour of retiring the list; it was spun up a long time ago, and we've migrated to Discourse. No need to keep the list. We voted to move all regular community communications to Discourse. Most people who are interested in the community have already migrated to Discourse.
- Jimmy agrees :) We will send one final email to the list and ask them to go to Discourse and sign up. Jimmy is going to write and send that email.
- See historial discussion: [A Discourse on Discourse](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/a-discourse-on-discourse/136)


### Discourse update
- Discourse was renewed and will continue to run until June 2024. 
- Jimmy discussed with OSPO and asked if they will continue to sponsor Open Org. They will provided the project if it shows a growth in activity. 
- Jimmy has been looking at the Discourse stats, we have about 25 anonymous users daily. We have some interesting spikes. Spikes tend to be around our monthly meetings. 
- Heidi: Need to have a think about Discourse and whether we want to keep it, which means using it, getting more people to use it, etc


### Status of our infrastructure
- we own website but URLs under RH control
    - Renewal of domains:
        - theopenorganization.org: Registry Expiry Date: 2023-10-16
        - theopenorganization.tv: Registry Expiry Date: 2024-05-04
        - theopenorganization.community: Registry Expiry Date: 2024-06-16
- Jos has some URLs that are Open Org related, so that's cool :) aka the "strategic URL reserve"


## Publication Updates

### New LinkedIn group
Shabnoor has created a new LinkedIn group devoted to open leadership: Open Leadership Community.

- Ron is publishing there, taking the newest articles first, and republishing the older ones afterwards; posts Thursdays and if in a series posts on consecutive days
- Support of Shabnoors linkedIn initiative
- Link: [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12866004/](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12866004/)
- How can this group and the Open Organization company page work together? [https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-open-organization/posts/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-open-organization/posts/), let's chat with Shabnoor!

### Status of Opensource.com
- Community still working on `opensource.net`
- See most recent updatE: https://opensource.com/article/23/6/new-developments-opensourcecom
- Consider joining the [new mailing list](http://lists.osnet.community/listinfo.cgi/osnet-writers-osnet.community) to stay on top of migration updates: http://lists.osnet.community/listinfo.cgi/osnet-writers-osnet.community


### Getting review help for articles 
- Emails + Hedgedoc vs Discourse (which has a forum called "writing center") 
- Need to know where materials will be published (LinkedIn, special audience) which impacts length
- Github is also a possibility, but it's a higher bar for people
- For now: If you need help with an article, put it in a HedgeDoc and send it to folks via email. Next steps to look at Discourse and see if we want to start discussions there. 

v1 process
- create a hedgedoc , get it reviewed by your choice of people
- publish it to Discourse
- later, iterate

LinkedIn management
- happy to add more managers on open organization linkedin group
