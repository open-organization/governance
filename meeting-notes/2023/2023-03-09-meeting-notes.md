### Time for monthly meeting
Going forward, to accommodate for our different schedules, we will alternate between the second Monday or Thursday of the month at 08:30 Eastern / 13:30 UTC / 14:30 CET.

### Video conferencing tool
Red Hat will decommission Bluejeans from 1st of April as we have moved entirely to Google Meet. Could/should we continue on Gmeet or what is an alternative we should use? [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is a free, open source alternative not requiring an [account or download an app](https://meet.jit.si/).

It will also mean that most of our archived meeting recordings will be deleted.

Go for Google Meet and evaluate later. Could also set up an OpenOrg Gmail to hold all the recordings.

### Social Media
Retire @OpenOrgProject on Twitter? Move to Mastodon? Or have Mastodon in parallell?
Any interest in Social Media Maintainer role?
How do we want to position ourselves?
What do we want to accomplish as a community?
Do/should we have a baseline of minimum expectation for activity?

We will keep Twitter for reach and that we do have over 7K followers. 

## Project Updates

### The Open Leadership Assessment
(Notes from the meeting 15 February):
How to evolve and maintain? In the next session brainstorm how we go forward.
Could we do a pilot to test online with a few communities. Reasons - test use, socialize that organizations can use this for their open networks (Heather and Shabnoor - maybe to explore)

Postponing this discussion to next meeting.

## Publication Updates

Open Organization Ambassador Emeritus Jen Kelchner is back with:

Opensource.com will soon publish a blog post about the Turkiye Syria Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) response. Heather Leson cowrote it with the HOT activation leads. They have spent a decade evolving their 'open org' and this helped them have more impact and trust for the response. (Thanks Jimmy And AmyJune for the support)
