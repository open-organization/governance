## Project Updates

### The Open Leadership Assessment
(Notes from the meeting 15 February):
How to evolve and maintain? In the next session brainstorm how we go forward.
Could we do a pilot to test online with a few communities. Reasons - test use, socialize that organizations can use this for their open networks (Heather and Shabnoor - maybe to explore)

Postponing this discussion to next meeting.

### Translating Open principles to other languages
Ron brought up a question if there would be interest in translating to other languages. Ron was involved in an assessment project similar to the Open Leadership assessment where they translated between Japanese and English. There was an addition of a [Dutch translation](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-definition/tree/master/Translations/Dutch) of the Open Organization definition in 2019. If there are incoming requests we will look into providing translations.

I don't see a posting for a May, 2023 meeting. Will there be a meeting scheduled for June, 2023?

### Jimmy | 2023-06-08 12:30:25 UTC

Thanks! The meetings notes for May was there but as it contained some internal information I had to clean it up a bit and then forgot to make it public, sorry... Now it should be visible for everyone.

### Bryan | 2023-06-08 12:35:41 UTC 

Thanks, @Jimmy and @scottworthington! A [meeting agenda is open for input](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/G32maTCxT6-2Gn97EerB6Q#).
