Maybe got an emeritus coming back to the community. Plans with Bryan to create the Leaders Manual version 3, maybe next year. Collaborating with Red Hat in Netherlands, created three webinars that might be shared with the community. Reached out to Jim Whitehurst in LinkedIn, as the new interim CEO for Unity, that we are still active in the Open Org community if they would like to collaborate.

### Ron
Posting old articles on LinkedIn, both in the [Open Organization](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-open-organization/) and [Open Leadership community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12866004/).
