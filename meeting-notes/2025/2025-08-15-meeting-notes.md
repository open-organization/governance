### Becoming more selfsufficient?
The question has been raised again about moving the administration of certain Open Org components from Red Hat to our own management. Specifically, this concerns HedgeDoc and the domain names with their DNS handling. While Red Hat has not indicated they plan to discontinue their support,  but we should consider a long-term strategy.

## Project Updates

### The Open Organization Leaders Manual, 3rd Edition
Bryan: The beginning of the year was a little busier than I imagined. But I am still keen to work on this if others are. Current status is glimpse-able via the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/open-organization/projects/4/views/1). The short version is that I have read all outstanding drafts and sent those in need of revision back to their respective authors. Some have already completed reivsions and we've moved those to `Typesetting`, which I'll do when a complete manuscript is ready for production. In the meantime, I'll continue responding to drafts when they come back in.

### Open Decision Framework
No update.

## Publication Updates

## Ambassador Updates
### Bryan
I have taken a more active role in maintaining *[The Open Source Way](https://www.theopensourceway.org/)* project, which is a guidebook of "best practices" in open source project and community management. The work started with a [complete refactor](https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook/pull/241) of the book to adopt a new publication platform, [GitBook](https://guidebook.theopensourceway.org/). Now we are back up and running and making nice advancements. Everyone here with experience and interest in open source project and community management is welcome to participate! We need authors, editors, proofreaders, issue triagers--the whole shebang.

### Ron
Articles steady coming, both new and transferring from [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) to [coachingbuttons.com](https://coachingbuttons.com/).

### Jimmy
No major updates to report, but the internal communication about The Open Organization book's 10-year anniversary got some traction at Red Hat.
