# December 9, 2024 Meeting
Meeting convened at 13:30 UTC / 08:30 Eastern / 14:30 CEST  
Meeting conducted via Jitsi Meet  

## Attendees

- Jimmy Sjolund
- Ron McFarland
- Bryan Behrenshausen

## Housekeeping

- Jimmy creates our monthly meeting series, but it's from his Red Hat account and it automatically appends a GMeet link. This could confuse folks. We may consider an alternative here.
- Jimmy and Bryan ran some tests and discovered that recording Jitsi meetings is only possible for those running Chrome.
- We're approaching the 10th year anniversary of the Open Organization book (2 June 2025).

## Project Updates

### The Open Organization Leaders Manual, 3rd Edition
See the project board for [current status](https://github.com/orgs/open-organization/projects/4/views/1).

(Bryan offers update on the book; see video or the project board.)

### Open Decision Framework
Been presenting about the framework; last was at Obeya Summit (see below). About 60 people attended the talk. Used the community-branded templates, spoke on behalf of community rather than the company. Felt good! Lots of great discussion.

## Publication Updates
 
## Ambassador Updates
### Jimmy
Spoke at the [Obeya Summit](https://obeya-association.com/events/obeya-summit-2024/), 15 Nov, about the Open Decision Framework. Great questions and discussions! Created two Brand issues as an outcome:
- [Move Open Organization Google Slides template](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/issues/1)
- [Update the Open Organization slides template with larger fonts](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/issues/2)
- Bryan can help with the conversion, etc. (bbehrens@brandeis.edu)
- Watched Johan Norberg on U.S television; brought back fond memories of [our discussion with him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93lwexPTcAM)
- Be sure to check out [We Love open Source](https://allthingsopen.org/articles), rekindled Opensource.com community!

### Ron
Closing in on 100 articles (published 82 articles to date). Jim has been reposting his corpus from Opensource.com. Backlog of article drafts is nearly empty. New project: how to rethinking former sales trainings in a new context. How to open up customer engagement and customer management. How can we rethink CRM with open organizational principles? Articles have sparked quite a bit of activity on LinkedIn. Also finished a chapter for the third edition of the Leaders Manual (see Bryan's update).

### Bryan
Working on the third edition of the Leaders Manual. Been going fine. Please read and respond to editorial feedback if you've recieved it. Working with Ben Owens on creating an open source handbook for his organization, Open Way Learning. That has been fun. Working on revitalizing the Open Source Way project, with former Red Hat colleagues.
