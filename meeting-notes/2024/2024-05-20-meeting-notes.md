## Project Updates
### Discourse migration
- migrated important and good to have historic materials. Not everything was migrated... there were some discussions and notes that were not kept as they weren't needed for archival purposes. There is a markdown archive file in each repo (each project name - eg Governance, etc) in GitHub. 
- Jimmy has the theopenorganization.community will point to GitHub and Jimmy updated the link on our website.
- last back up of discourse on Apr 29 we can use in a discourse installation if needed 


### Next edition of Leaders Manual
Bryan: We've been batting this around for a while. How are we still feeling about it?
- The amount of work is decreased by having the publication process within each chapter, which is now https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual 
- writing is on github, with collaborative editing, each chapter is seperate
- but the build process is not totally automated - so there is work to produce the new complete version of the book
- other opportunities: can update the title, look and feel, layout, cover (now that we are not in RH OSPO)

Tasks: 
1. update TOC with what chapters we have
2. reorganize book according to open org definition/principles and put chapters in the different slots for values
3. identify gaps in what materials are needed for what values, identify what to drop/update from the new edition
4. socialize with the larger team and promote with new people/new channels (being specific can lead to invitations or public volunteers)
5. authors commit to chapters
6. writing begins 

ACTION: Bryan to create a new TOC on GitHub for community review and discussion. Authors to identify what they want to do with their chapters, or other author's chapters, feedback on what's missing, etc. Will use GitHub Discussions

## Publication Updates
- Reminder that coaching buttons focuses on articles with leadership perspectives
- Shabnoor's podcast is [available on Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/openleadership/episodes/Trailer-Introduction-to-Open-Leadership-and-Open-Organisations-Podcast-e2alji1)
 
## Ambassador Updates

### Ron McFarland
In March, wrote [a hypothetical piece](https://coachingbuttons.com/2024/03/11/envisionmovie) about what an "open organization movie" might be like (an idea for a plotâ€”see below); sent this to a bunch of potential writers and some responded (but unfortunately this requires funding). Receiving lots of comments on Shabnoor's podcast series.

### Jim Hall
Still publishing Coaching Buttons once per week. Jos has republished a few things recently. Right now, focused on job search-related articles. In fall: Jim will collect a few articles from Coaching Buttons and turn them into an eBook. But contributing now, you're making yourself eligible for inclusion.

## Upcoming discussions and tasks
 1. X, the former Twitter? Do we want to continue using? Or maybe Mastodon?
 2. Using an open source meeting thingy like https://meet.jit.si/
