How to migrate
get the page you want to migrate

remove from /t up to the number
add raw
as in https://www.theopenorganization.community/raw/348

1. Discourse migration

Current state: 
- Editorial archive, all published material (but not Ron's stuff on coachingbuttons)
- Meeting notes, BB has archived 2024-2023 and 2022 are done. How far back do we go? on Discourse, we go back to 2019. In 2016 there are notes from our in person meeting.
- Jimmy looking into levels in Discourse and how to manage in GitHub

  
Future Items: 

- Point to link to GitHub on the theopenorganization.org
- Three levels of access, Everyone (teal bands), LoggedIn (dark blue bands, level up as posts increase), Ambassador Only (purple bands)
- other stuff on Discourse to migrate -- governance, etc -- it is organized by topic and GitHub is organized by project. Are their discussions we want to move over? They come in a single discussion, so it's easy to migrate.
- DECISION TO MIGRATE - prioritize resources, tools, announcements, community reports, 
- NOT NEEDED: job board, social media, conferences 
- LOW PRIORITY: research, ambassador lounge, project discussion, 

- Do we need to be concerned about moving things to GitHub? Jimmy think we might be "saved" by the Terms and Condidions on moving everything: https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/terms-of-service. Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum. That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.
