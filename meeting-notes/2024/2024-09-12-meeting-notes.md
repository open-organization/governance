## Ambassador Updates

### Bryan
Learned this week that I will be attending All Things Open in Raleigh this October.

### Heather
My only headline is that we are in the middle of changing governance at HOT (adding appointed board members. a two year process of research, consultation, lawyers and going to a vote). We have tried to be as transparent and inclusive as possible in the processes. There is such low engagement overall in governance – this is worrisome. I’ve talked with other open organization leaders (including the MetaGov folks) and they are in a similar space. Allen Gunn is running an Open Board Summit – I think this interplays with open organizations – we need to nail leadership and governance to buy into the open promise. http://openboardssummit.org/ My question is would this be a good place for open organization community to link the leadership techniques/research. I want to go and commit to writing something but there is a large work deadline around then.let me know if you are going
