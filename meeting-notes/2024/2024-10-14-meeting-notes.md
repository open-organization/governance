### The Open Organization Leaders Manual, 3rd Edition

Editorial work is ongoing. Please see [the project board](https://github.com/orgs/open-organization/projects/4/views/1) for a complete overview of the state of things.

Accomplished last month:

- First edit of Jim's chapter on [open leadership lessons from open source community management](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/issues/60)
- First edit of Shabnoor's chapter on [open leadership in IT](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/issues/47)
- First edit to Shabnoor's chapter on [open leadership and high-performing teams](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/issues/61)

Waiting on authors to review and respond to inquiries and suggestions.

Up next month:

- Complete first edit of Ron's chapter on [open leadership in the face of noise](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/issues/52)
- Will cajole Jimmy into finished a draft of his chapter(s)

Note to authors: Bryan has been using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) to do editorial work, because it's an open platform that uses Markdown for editing and easily integrates with GitHub. When he and authors have finished their work in a document (cf., Jim's [chapter draft](https://hackmd.io/@semioticrobotic/SyPUgzyTA)), Bryan can push directly to the GitHub project, saving time and reducing errors.

### Open Decision Framework
Heidi, Laura, and Jimmy are drafting a new revision of the framework, updating vocabulary and updating to open organization and open leadership principles. Once complete, run by the Ambassadors for feedback.

Once it's in a google doc, then we have to do the markdown again. But Laura says maybe just AI it. Jimmy will set up a googleDoc.
