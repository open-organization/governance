## Housekeeping

### Selecting new meeting platform
Bryan: Using Google Meet has become untenable and we need to discuss options for a different platform for monthly meetings.
Anyone should be able to host, start, and run a meeting. No emojis! Preference for collective control of outputs/recordings and an open system.
* Suggestion: Jitsi
* Report back on Jitsi (Bryan, Laura, Allison) â€“ https://meet.jit.si/
* https://jitsi.support/wiki/understanding-jitsi-basics

## Project Updates
On June 2, 2025 the Open Organization community is 10 years old.
We should have a think about that.
Ron has learned a lot over these years, and we've all learned a lot together. 
Maybe do an interview with Jim Whitehurst?

### Leaders Manual, Third Edition
Bryan: We've made great strides since last month.
Initiated a discussion, as promised, and it was well-received. 
Please see:

* [The discussion](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-leaders-manual/discussions/51)
* [The project](https://github.com/orgs/open-organization/projects/4/views/1)

We can pre-publish this work on Coaching Buttons. 
Ron recommends reaching out to Gib Bulloch when our needs become clearer.

### Open Decision Framework
(Jimmy can correct Bryan's overview) - Most of us remember the ODF. The repo has fallen into disrepair, it's part of Red Hat people team's repos. Long story short, Jimmy is a champion and speaking a lot about open org stuff and ODF, gets loads of questions. #1 question he gets - How can I contribute? Jimmy is now an owner. 
Allison: We could fork this, and change whatever we want. 
Jimmy is investigating the status of the ODF and see if we could move it or if we need to fork it.
Laura would like to apply our very nice Open Org branding to the ODF, so let's get this over into our yard.
Laura will add a discussion to our Governance repo and tag Jimmy so everyone can discuss/read updates: https://github.com/open-organization/governance/discussions/26

## Publication Updates
Jim Hall update from Coaching Buttons: A few new articles from Ron are coming up.

Ron: I've been writing and thinking about startups for quite some time. Idea here is "startups as an alterantive to traditional employee role." Emphasis is on leadership and self-generating projects/initiatives. 

These are going live in July (July 01 and 08).

Hint, hint: Jim would love to have an article about the Open Decision Framework!

To work with Jim: Send articles in any format (Google Docs, Markdown, LibreOffice, etc.) Send articles to Jim (jim@hallmentum.com), and he'll edit and typset, then you'll receive a preview link.
