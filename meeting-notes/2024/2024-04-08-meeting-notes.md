## Project Updates
### Discourse to GitHub migration

See [notes on this project](https://notes.theopenorganization.org/D3S_FmtpROmE5ZJ9YWuccA?view).

- JS: Check if we can see statistics on accessed discussions, then discuss migrating popular ones, delete any threads not read in a certain amount of time.

How far back do we want to migrate over?

BB update, from 3/21:

- BB to archive Ron's stuff on coachingbuttons - update - archived to GH
- BB to [migrate](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/tree/master) 2016 meeting notes - update: **done**
- BB to [migrate](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/tree/master) community reports - update: **done**
- ambassadors project, resource folder - update - migrated messaging guide, presentation archive, etc 

1. cover the decision on what to move, not move, and move if possible

  - Ron asked if we can see the click throughs / clicks on the different Discourse files? Jimmy is looking at what the click views are for the materials . Otherwise, framework seems ok to move forward

2. discuss whether migrating is a permissions issue that is covered by the T & C

  - It seems the T&C would cover migrating any content we wished to. However, the materials BB is migrating are largely static documents (no discussion on documents). If there are comments to move with the resource, they are mostly minimal and benign. Some cases are a community discussion about governance, infrastructure, etc.. BB will move and notify if someone outside the group of Ambassadors has made a comment—and not move it. 

Next steps:

- Need help reviewing the materials and deciding what to migrate and what to archive (provide a list of links)
- Heather to look at community governance 

## Publication Updates and Ambassador Updates 

Ron:
- promoting article about movie companies being more accountable.
- stakeholder board article - commiting a company to be more responsible to all stakeholders including the environment
- has 64 articles in opensource.com. Can Jim migrate them to coachingbuttons? Ron would hate to lose them if opensource.com closes. Jim is open to reposting them on coachingbuttons. Ron to let him know and work with him to determine next steps. 
 
Jim
