# Information for the Open Organization community on Red Hat + IBM

Today marks a new day in the 26-year history of Red Hat. IBM has finalized its acquisition of Red Hat, which will operate as a distinct unit within IBM moving forward.

What does this mean for Red Hat's contributions to the open organization community?

In short, nothing.

Red Hat always has and will continue to be a champion for open source and projects—like the open organization community—that have played such an important role in shaping how we understand open cultural principles around the world. IBM is committed to Red Hat's independence and role in open source communities so that we can continue this work without interruption or changes.

Our mission, governance, and objectives remain the same. We will continue to execute the existing project roadmap. Red Hat associates will continue to contribute to the upstream in the same ways they have been. And, as always, we will continue to help upstream projects be successful and contribute to welcoming new members and maintaining the project.

We will do this together, with the community, as we always have.
