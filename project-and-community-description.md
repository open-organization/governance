# The Open Organization project and community

## Our purpose

The Open Organization is a community-driven project leading a global conversation about the ways open principles change how people work, manage, and lead.

Our community members generate knowledge and share strategies for building organizational cultures on principles like transparency, adaptability, collaboration, inclusivity, and community.

## Our commitments

We're committed to:

- **Empowering.** We're a trusted source of expertise for anyone interested in leveraging the power of open principles to improve their organizations.
- **Engaging.** We draw others into productive dialogues and exploratory activities that illuminate the benefits of applying open thinking to organizational contexts.
- **Translating.** We explain community-specific vocabularies to general audiences seeking to understand the benefits of an open approach to management and leadership.
- **Learning.** We research open values and principles so we can better understand how they're influencing today's innovative organizational cultures, and we're always refining the "open organization" concept, differentiating or distinguishing it from seemingly similar approaches to management and leadership.

## Our methods

We do all this by:

- Connecting with and fostering relationships between innovative leaders, managers, and practitioners innovating in an open way
- Co-creating case studies, books, videos, and other resources exploring the nature of openness in contemporary organizations
- Exhibiting and speaking at industry and community-focused events to expand awareness of open principles and their benefits
- Maintaining a repository of high-quality, immediately accessible, vetted resources anyone can use to implement open practices in their teams or organizations

## Our contributors

The Open Organization project welcomes contributors of all kinds.

Our community members have diverse backgrounds; they're people from a number of different of domains (consulting, education, non-profits, open source software development, and more) who possess varying levels of experience and technical proficiencies. They [play different roles](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Community-Roles) in the Open Organization project. But they all:

- Consider themselves champions of open organizational values and principles, as outlined in the [Open Organization Definition](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-definition),
- Care about the ways those values can help create better organizational experiences for everyone, and
- Enjoy working productively with others who feel the same way.
